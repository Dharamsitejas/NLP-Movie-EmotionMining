﻿1
1
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,019
1
13 meters. You should see it.
1

2
2
2
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,051
2
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.
2

3
3
3
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:12,699
3
Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.
3
Stay with us.
3

4
4
4
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,572
4
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.
4

5
5
5
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:51,577
5
Seeing her coming out of the darkness
5
like a ghost ship ...
5

6
6
6
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,572
6
still gets me every time.
6

7
7
7
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:57,929
7
To see the sad ruin of the great ship,
7
sitting here ...
7

8
8
8
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:03,098
8
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning
8
of April 15, 1912 ...
8

9
9
9
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,378
9
after her long fall ...
9

10
10
10
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,939
10
from the world above.
10

11
11
11
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,657
11
You're so full of shit, boss.
11

12
12
12
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,569
12
Dive 6.
12

13
13
13
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,492
13
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.
13

14
14
14
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,490
14
2½ miles down.
14

15
15
15
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,169
15
3,821 meters.
15

16
16
16
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,048
16
The pressure outside
16
is 3½ tons per square inch.
16

17
17
17
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,858
17
These windows are 9 inches thick
17
and if they go ...
17

18
18
18
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,248
18
it's sayonara in 2 microseconds.
18

19
19
19
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,368
19
All right, enough of that bullshit.
19

20
20
20
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,889
20
Just put her down on the roof
20
of the officers' quarters like yesterday.
20

21
21
21
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:18,967
21
Sure.
21

22
22
22
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,136
22
Okay, Mir-2, we're landing
22
right over the Grand Staircase.
22

23
23
23
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,015
23
You guys set to launch?
23

24
24
24
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:27,051
24
Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.
24
Go, Charlie.
24

25
25
25
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,934
25
- All right, tether out.
25
- Tether out.
25

26
26
26
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:40,256
26
Okay, Brock,
26
we're dropping down along the hull.
26

27
27
27
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:46,969
27
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,
27
and go into the first-class gangway door.
27

28
28
28
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:51,255
28
I want you guys working the "D" deck
28
reception area and the dining saloon.
28

29
29
29
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,171
29
Copy that.
29

30
30
30
00:04:58,777 --> 00:04:59,892
30
- Tether out.
30
- Tether out.
30

31
31
31
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,013
31
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.
31

32
32
32
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:13,933
32
Snoop Dog is on the move.
32
We're headed down the stairwell.
32

33
33
33
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,968
33
Okay, Lewis, drop down to "B" deck.
33

34
34
34
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,245
34
"A" deck.
34

35
35
35
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,010
35
- Give me some rope, Captain.
35
- "B" deck. Get in there.
35

36
36
36
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,692
36
- Watch the door frame. Watch it.
36
- I see it. I got it.
36

37
37
37
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:11,409
37
We're good. Just chill, boss.
37

38
38
38
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,372
38
Okay, make your turn.
38

39
39
39
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,603
39
- Cable out, Captain.
39
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.
39

40
40
40
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,083
40
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?
40

41
41
41
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:33,722
41
Copy that.
41

42
42
42
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,728
42
Right there.
42

43
43
43
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:45,772
43
- That's it. That's the bedroom door.
43
- I see it.
43

44
44
44
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,045
44
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.
44

45
45
45
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:03,849
45
That's Hockley's bed.
45
That's where the son of a bitch slept.
45

46
46
46
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,768
46
Oops. Somebody left the water running.
46

47
47
47
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,651
47
Hold it. Just a second.
47
Go back to the right.
47

48
48
48
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,968
48
That wardrobe door. Get closer.
48

49
49
49
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,730
49
- You're smelling something, boss.
49
- I want to see what's under it.
49

50
50
50
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,609
50
Give me my hands, man.
50

51
51
51
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,840
51
All right.
51

52
52
52
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,845
52
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
52
- Okay.
52

53
53
53
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,402
53
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.
53

54
54
54
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,125
54
Keep going. Go.
54

55
55
55
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,451
55
Okay, drop it.
55

56
56
56
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:58,565
56
Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?
56

57
57
57
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:03,603
57
It's payday, boys.
57

58
58
58
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,205
58
Cha-ching!
58

59
59
59
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,959
59
- We did it, Bobby.
59
- We brought it back.
59

60
60
60
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,405
60
Oh, yeah! You the man!
60

61
61
61
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,562
61
Who's the best, baby? Say it.
61

62
62
62
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,369
62
You are, Lewis.
62

63
63
63
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,966
63
- Bobby, my cigar.
63
- Right here.
63

64
64
64
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,129
64
Okay, crack her open.
64

65
65
65
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,685
65
Let me get around. Hang on.
65

66
66
66
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,044
66
- You getting it?
66
- Got it.
66

67
67
67
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,398
67
Shit.
67

68
68
68
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,723
68
No diamond.
68

69
69
69
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,199
69
You know, boss,
69
this same thing happened to Geraldo ...
69

70
70
70
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,847
70
and his career never recovered.
70

71
71
71
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,962
71
Turn the camera off.
71

72
72
72
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,166
72
Brock. The partners would like to know
72
how it's going.
72

73
73
73
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,039
73
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.
73
Look, it wasn't in the safe.
73

74
74
74
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:38,518
74
Don't worry about it. There are
74
still plenty of places it could be.
74

75
75
75
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:39,597
75
Hell, yes.
75

76
76
76
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:42,043
76
The floor debris in the suite,
76
the mother's room ...
76

77
77
77
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,483
77
- The purser's safe on "C" deck.
77
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.
77

78
78
78
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,762
78
A dozen other places.
78

79
79
79
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:49,079
79
Guys, look, you just got to trust
79
my instincts. I know we're close.
79

80
80
80
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,399
80
We just got to go through
80
a little process of elimination.
80

81
81
81
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:54,646
81
Hang on a second.
81

82
82
82
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,964
82
- Let me see that.
82
- We might have something here, guys.
82

83
83
83
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,204
83
- Where's the photograph of the necklace?
83
- We'll call you right back.
83

84
84
84
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,080
84
I'll be goddamned.
84

85
85
85
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,764
85
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
85
is best known for finding Spanish gold.
85

86
86
86
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,315
86
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.
86

87
87
87
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:31,036
87
He has chartered Russian subs to reach
87
the most famous shipwreck of all ...
87

88
88
88
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,446
88
the Titanic.
88

89
89
89
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:36,042
89
He's with us live via satellite,
89
from the research ship Keldysh ...
89

90
90
90
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,401
90
in the North Atlantic.
90

91
91
91
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,523
91
- Hello, Brock.
91
- Hello, Tracy.
91

92
92
92
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,525
92
Of course, everyone knows
92
the familiar stories of Titanic.
92

93
93
93
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:45,996
93
You know, the nobility of the band
93
playing to the very end and all that.
93

94
94
94
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,441
94
But what I'm interested in
94
are the untold stories ...
94

95
95
95
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,040
95
the secrets locked deep inside
95
the hull of Titanic.
95

96
96
96
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:54,323
96
And we're out here using robot technology
96
to go further into the wreck ...
96

97
97
97
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,158
97
than anybody has ever done before.
97

98
98
98
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:58,396
98
Your expedition is at the center
98
of a storm ...
98

99
99
99
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,364
99
of controversy over salvage rights,
99
and even ethics.
99

100
100
100
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,198
100
Many are calling you a grave-robber.
100

101
101
101
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,403
101
Nobody ever called the recovery
101
of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb ...
101

102
102
102
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,556
102
- What is it?
102
- Turn that up, dear.
102

103
103
103
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,319
103
I have museum-trained experts
103
sent out here making sure ...
103

104
104
104
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:14,238
104
that these relics are preserved
104
and catalogued properly.
104

105
105
105
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,158
105
Take a look at this drawing
105
that we found just today.
105

106
106
106
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,442
106
A piece of paper that's been underwater
106
for 84 years ...
106

107
107
107
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,403
107
and my team are able to preserve it intact.
107

108
108
108
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,959
108
Should this have remained unseen
108
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?
108

109
109
109
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,478
109
We can see it and ...
109

110
110
110
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,157
110
I'll be goddamned.
110

111
111
111
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:37,323
111
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.
111

112
112
112
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,956
112
Bobby, we're launching. See these
112
submersibles going in the water?
112

113
113
113
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,798
113
Trust me, buddy,
113
you want to take this call.
113

114
114
114
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,522
114
This better be good.
114

115
115
115
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:50,235
115
- You got to speak up. She's kind of old.
115
- Great.
115

116
116
116
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,953
116
This is Brock Lovett.
116
How can I help you, Mrs. ...
116

117
117
117
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:56,796
117
Calvert. Rose Calvert.
117

118
118
118
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,517
118
Mrs. Calvert?
118

119
119
119
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:04,114
119
I was just wondering if you had found
119
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.
119

120
120
120
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,839
120
Told you you wanted to take the call.
120

121
121
121
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,797
121
All right, you have my attention, Rose.
121

122
122
122
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,075
122
Can you tell us who the woman
122
in the picture is?
122

123
123
123
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:18,757
123
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.
123

124
124
124
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,638
124
She's a goddamn liar!
124
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.
124

125
125
125
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:42,958
125
God only knows why!
125
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.
125

126
126
126
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,635
126
They're inbound!
126

127
127
127
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:53,431
127
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
127
when she was 17, right?
127

128
128
128
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,637
128
That's right.
128

129
129
129
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,236
129
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.
129

130
130
130
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:59,438
130
101 next month.
130

131
131
131
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,315
131
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.
131

132
132
132
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,957
132
Look, I've already done the background
132
on this woman ...
132

133
133
133
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,751
133
all the way back to the '20s,
133
when she was working as an actress.
133

134
134
134
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,720
134
An actress.
134
There's your first clue, Sherlock.
134

135
135
135
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:16,239
135
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
135
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.
135

136
136
136
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,758
136
They move to Cedar Rapids
136
and she punches out a couple of kids.
136

137
137
137
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,799
137
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,
137
Cedar Rapids is dead.
137

138
138
138
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,519
138
And everybody
138
who knows about the diamond ...
138

139
139
139
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,479
139
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,
139
but she knows.
139

140
140
140
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,835
140
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?
140

141
141
141
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,639
141
Hurry up, give him a hand!
141

142
142
142
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:48,277
142
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
142
Welcome to the Keldysh.
142

143
143
143
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,792
143
Okay, let's get her inside there.
143

144
144
144
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,632
144
- Hi, Miss Calvert.
144
- Hi.
144

145
145
145
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,518
145
- Welcome to the Keldysh.
145
- Thanks.
145

146
146
146
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,349
146
Yes?
146

147
147
147
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,637
147
- Are your staterooms all right?
147
- Oh, yes, very nice.
147

148
148
148
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,635
148
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?
148
She takes care of me.
148

149
149
149
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,757
149
We met just a few minutes ago.
149
Remember, Nana, up on deck?
149

150
150
150
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,915
150
Oh, yeah ...
150

151
151
151
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,152
151
There. That's nice.
151
Have to have my pictures when I travel.
151

152
152
152
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,996
152
Can I get you anything?
152
Is there anything you'd like?
152

153
153
153
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,354
153
Yes.
153

154
154
154
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,034
154
I would like to see my drawing.
154

155
155
155
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,757
155
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone
155
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.
155

156
156
156
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,228
156
It disappeared in 1792.
156

157
157
157
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,792
157
About the same time old Louis
157
lost everything from the neck up.
157

158
158
158
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:02,468
158
The theory goes that the
158
crown diamond was chopped, too.
158

159
159
159
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:06,950
159
Re-cut into a heart-like shape that
159
became known as the "Heart of the Ocean".
159

160
160
160
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,030
160
Today, it would be worth
160
more than the Hope Diamond.
160

161
161
161
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,316
161
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
161
I only wore it this once.
161

162
162
162
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,946
162
You actually think this is you, Nana?
162

163
163
163
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,557
163
It is me, dear.
163

164
164
164
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,876
164
Wasn't I a dish?
164

165
165
165
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,396
165
I tracked it down
165
through insurance records.
165

166
166
166
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:29,152
166
An old claim that was settled
166
under terms of absolute secrecy.
166

167
167
167
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,876
167
Can you tell me
167
who the claimant was, Rose?
167

168
168
168
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,751
168
I should imagine someone named Hockley.
168

169
169
169
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:39,308
169
Nathan Hockley. That's right.
169
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.
169

170
170
170
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:44,668
170
The claim was for a diamond necklace
170
his son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you.
170

171
171
171
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,906
171
A week before he sailed on Titanic.
171

172
172
172
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:51,271
172
It was filed right after the sinking.
172

173
173
173
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:54,947
173
So the diamond had to have gone down
173
with the ship.
173

174
174
174
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,596
174
You see the date?
174

175
175
175
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,594
175
April 14, 1912.
175

176
176
176
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:03,475
176
Which means if your grandmother
176
is who she says she is ...
176

177
177
177
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,753
177
she was wearing the diamond
177
the day the Titanic sank.
177

178
178
178
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,396
178
And that makes you my new best friend.
178

179
179
179
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:13,826
179
These are some of the things
179
we recovered from your stateroom.
179

180
180
180
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:17,435
180
This was mine.
180

181
181
181
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,474
181
How extraordinary!
181

182
182
182
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:24,872
182
And it looks the same as it did
182
the last time I saw it.
182

183
183
183
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,545
183
The reflection has changed a bit.
183

184
184
184
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,104
184
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?
184

185
185
185
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,824
185
Here we go.
185
She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.
185

186
186
186
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:02,950
186
She kind of bumps along, punching holes
186
like Morse code along the side ...
186

187
187
187
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,547
187
below the water line.
187

188
188
188
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,704
188
Then the forward compartments
188
start to flood.
188

189
189
189
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:10,628
189
Now, as the water level rises,
189
it spills over the watertight bulkheads ...
189

190
190
190
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,751
190
which, unfortunately,
190
don't go any higher than "E" deck.
190

191
191
191
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:17,986
191
So now, as the bow goes down,
191
the stern rises up, slow at first ...
191

192
192
192
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:22,465
192
then faster and faster, until finally,
192
she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.
192

193
193
193
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,944
193
And that's a big ass.
193
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.
193

194
194
194
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:28,874
194
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal
194
with that pressure.
194

195
195
195
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:32,469
195
So what happens?
195
She splits, right down to the keel ...
195

196
196
196
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,069
196
and the stern falls back level.
196

197
197
197
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:40,389
197
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern
197
vertical and then finally detaches.
197

198
198
198
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:45,665
198
Now the stern section kind of bobs there
198
like a cork for a couple of minutes ...
198

199
199
199
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,347
199
floods, and finally goes under
199
about 2:20 am ...
199

200
200
200
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,231
200
2 hours and 40 minutes
200
after the collision.
200

201
201
201
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:55,952
201
The bow section planes away,
201
landing about a ½ a mile away ...
201

202
202
202
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,945
202
going 20, 30 knots
202
when it hits the ocean floor.
202

203
203
203
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,745
203
Pretty cool, huh?
203

204
204
204
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,620
204
Thank you for that fine
204
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.
204

205
205
205
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,421
205
Of course,
205
the experience of it was —
205

206
206
206
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,503
206
somewhat different.
206

207
207
207
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,143
207
Will you share it with us?
207

208
208
208
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,661
208
- I'm taking her to rest.
208
- No.
208

209
209
209
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,667
209
- Come on, Nana.
209
- No!
209

210
210
210
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,501
210
Give me the tape recorder.
210

211
211
211
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,183
211
Tell us, Rose.
211

212
212
212
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,828
212
It's been 84 years.
212

213
213
213
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,740
213
It's okay. Just try to remember
213
anything, anything at all.
213

214
214
214
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,388
214
Do you want to hear this
214
or not, Mr. Lovett?
214

215
215
215
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,068
215
It's been 84 years ...
215

216
216
216
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,337
216
and I can still smell the fresh paint.
216

217
217
217
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,625
217
The china had never been used.
217

218
218
218
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,138
218
The sheets had never been slept in.
218

219
219
219
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,665
219
Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams".
219

220
220
220
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,423
220
And it was.
220

221
221
221
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,902
221
It really was.
221

222
222
222
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:37,780
222
All third-class passengers
222
with a forward berth ...
222

223
223
223
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,666
223
this way, please!
223
This queue! Right here ...
223

224
224
224
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,740
224
- It's a big boat, huh?
224
- Daddy, it's a ship.
224

225
225
225
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,226
225
You're right.
225

226
226
226
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:16,101
226
I don't see what all the fuss is about.
226

227
227
227
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,702
227
It doesn't look any bigger
227
than the Mauretania.
227

228
228
228
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:22,017
228
You can be blasé about some things,
228
Rose, but not about Titanic.
228

229
229
229
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:26,065
229
It's over 100 feet longer than
229
Mauretania, and far more luxurious.
229

230
230
230
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,337
230
Your daughter is far too difficult
230
to impress, Ruth.
230

231
231
231
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,701
231
So this is the ship
231
they say is unsinkable.
231

232
232
232
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:34,300
232
It is unsinkable.
232
God himself could not sink this ship.
232

233
233
233
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,105
233
Sir, you have to check your baggage
233
through the main terminal.
233

234
234
234
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,221
234
It's round that way, sir.
234

235
235
235
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,661
235
I put my faith in you, good sir.
235
Now, kindly see my man.
235

236
236
236
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,419
236
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
236
If I can do anything at all ...
236

237
237
237
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,780
237
Yes, right.
237

238
238
238
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:48,619
238
All the trunks from that car there.
238
12 from here.
238

239
239
239
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:53,901
239
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
239
rooms B-52, 54, 56.
239

240
240
240
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:59,221
240
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.
240

241
241
241
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:05,696
241
- My coat?
241
- I have it, miss.
241

242
242
242
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,174
242
Queue here for health inspection.
242

243
243
243
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:11,894
243
All third-class passengers
243
queue here for health inspection.
243

244
244
244
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:13,739
244
Chin up.
244

245
245
245
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,217
245
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
245
- Welcome to Titanic.
245

246
246
246
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:25,613
246
It was the ship of dreams
246
to everyone else.
246

247
247
247
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,380
247
To me, it was a slave ship ...
247

248
248
248
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:31,663
248
taking me back to America in chains.
248

249
249
249
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,743
249
Outwardly, I was everything
249
a well brought up girl should be.
249

250
250
250
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,174
250
Inside, I was screaming.
250

251
251
251
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:58,301
251
Jack, you are pazzo.
251
You bet everything we have.
251

252
252
252
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:02,181
252
When you got nothing,
252
you got nothing to lose.
252

253
253
253
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,018
253
Sven?
253

254
254
254
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:11,892
254
Bet.
254

255
255
255
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:31,451
255
All right.
255

256
256
256
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,739
256
Moment of truth.
256
Somebody's life is about to change.
256

257
257
257
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:36,977
257
Brizio?
257

258
258
258
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:40,461
258
- Niente.
258
- Niente.
258

259
259
259
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,891
259
Olaf?
259

260
260
260
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,971
260
Nothing.
260

261
261
261
00:23:45,222 --> 00:23:46,257
261
Sven?
261

262
262
262
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,810
262
2 pair.
262

263
263
263
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,940
263
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.
263

264
264
264
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,932
264
Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!
264
Did you bet all our money?
264

265
265
265
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:59,900
265
I'm sorry, you're not going to
265
see your mom again for a long time.
265

266
266
266
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:03,219
266
'Cause we're going to America.
266
Full house, boys.
266

267
267
267
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,776
267
Come on.
267

268
268
268
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:20,340
268
I'm going home!
268

269
269
269
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,541
269
- I'm going home.
269
- I go to America!
269

270
270
270
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,374
270
No, mate.
270

271
271
271
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:31,056
271
Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes.
271

272
272
272
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,328
272
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.
272

273
273
273
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,978
273
We're riding in high style now.
273
We're a couple of regular swells.
273

274
274
274
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,052
274
We're practically goddamn royalty,
274
ragazzo mio.
274

275
275
275
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,176
275
You see? Is my destino.
275

276
276
276
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,491
276
Like I told you,
276
I go to America to be millionaire.
276

277
277
277
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,417
277
- You are pazzo.
277
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.
277

278
278
278
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:58,488
278
- I thought you were fast.
278
- Aspetta!
278

279
279
279
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:01,293
279
Wait! Hey, wait!
279

280
280
280
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,371
280
We're passengers! Passengers!
280

281
281
281
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,211
281
Have you been through
281
the inspection queue?
281

282
282
282
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,334
282
Of course.
282

283
283
283
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,570
283
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
283
We're Americans, both of us.
283

284
284
284
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,457
284
Right. Come aboard.
284

285
285
285
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,289
285
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
285
in the world. You know that?
285

286
286
286
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,293
286
Goodbye!
286

287
287
287
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,536
287
- You know somebody?
287
- Of course not. That's not the point.
287

288
288
288
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,973
288
- Goodbye. I'll miss you.
288
- Goodbye!
288

289
289
289
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,618
289
- Goodbye.
289
- I will never forget you!
289

290
290
290
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,255
290
Come with me, darling. Let's go.
290

291
291
291
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,570
291
G-60.
291

292
292
292
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,614
292
Excuse me, ma'am.
292

293
293
293
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:42,255
293
Right here.
293

294
294
294
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:45,607
294
How you doing? Jack.
294
Nice to meet you.
294

295
295
295
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,769
295
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
295
How you doing?
295

296
296
296
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,766
296
Who says you get top bunk?
296

297
297
297
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,525
297
This is your private
297
promenade deck, sir.
297

298
298
298
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,335
298
Would you be requiring anything?
298
Excuse me.
298

299
299
299
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,689
299
- This one?
299
- No.
299

300
300
300
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,967
300
It had a lot of faces on it.
300

301
301
301
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,488
301
This is the one.
301

302
302
302
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,851
302
Would you like all of them out, miss?
302

303
303
303
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,608
303
Yes, we need a little color in this room.
303

304
304
304
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,127
304
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.
304

305
305
305
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,005
305
God, not those finger-paintings again.
305

306
306
306
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,892
306
They certainly were a waste of money.
306

307
307
307
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,251
307
The difference between Cal's taste
307
in art and mine is that I have some.
307

308
308
308
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:31,007
308
They're fascinating ...
308

309
309
309
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,444
309
like being inside a dream or something.
309

310
310
310
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,134
310
There's truth, but no logic.
310

311
311
311
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:38,206
311
- What's the artist's name?
311
- Something Picasso.
311

312
312
312
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:42,287
312
Something Picasso. He won't amount
312
to a thing. He won't, trust me.
312

313
313
313
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,127
313
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
313
- At least they were cheap.
313

314
314
314
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,685
314
Put it in the wardrobe.
314

315
315
315
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:56,486
315
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
315
named Margaret Brown.
315

316
316
316
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,691
316
We all called her Molly.
316

317
317
317
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,931
317
History would call her
317
the "Unsinkable Molly Brown".
317

318
318
318
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:04,614
318
I wasn't about to wait
318
all day for you, sonny.
318

319
319
319
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,889
319
Here, if you think you can manage.
319

320
320
320
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,965
320
Her husband had struck gold,
320
someplace out west.
320

321
321
321
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:13,012
321
And she was what mother called
321
"New Money. "
321

322
322
322
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:17,051
322
By the next afternoon,
322
we were steaming west ...
322

323
323
323
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,124
323
from the coast of Ireland ...
323

324
324
324
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,966
324
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.
324

325
325
325
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:32,291
325
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
325
Let's stretch her legs.
325

326
326
326
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:33,881
326
Yes, sir.
326

327
327
327
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,732
327
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
327
- Very good, sir.
327

328
328
328
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:45,092
328
All ahead full.
328

329
329
329
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,244
329
All ahead full!
329

330
330
330
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:49,449
330
Come on, lads, step lively.
330

331
331
331
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:57,524
331
What's the reading?
331

332
332
332
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:10,202
332
All right! Let's stoke her right up!
332
We go full ahead!
332

333
333
333
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,168
333
Come on, right back to work.
333

334
334
334
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,568
334
21 knots, sir.
334

335
335
335
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,727
335
Hey, look!
335

336
336
336
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:20,483
336
See it?
336

337
337
337
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,039
337
There's another one. See him?
337

338
338
338
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,038
338
Look at that one! Look at him jump!
338

339
339
339
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:04,927
339
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.
339

340
340
340
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:07,006
340
Very small, of course.
340

341
341
341
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,808
341
I'm the king of the world!
341

342
342
342
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,318
342
She's the largest moving object ever made
342
by the hand of man in all history.
342

343
343
343
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:06,758
343
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,
343
here, designed her from the keel plates up.
343

344
344
344
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:10,555
344
I may have knocked her together,
344
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.
344

345
345
345
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,804
345
He envisioned a steamer
345
so grand in scale ...
345

346
346
346
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,839
346
and so luxurious in its appointments that
346
its supremacy would never be challenged.
346

347
347
347
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:21,521
347
And here she is,
347
willed into solid reality.
347

348
348
348
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,924
348
Hear, hear.
348

349
349
349
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,478
349
The salmon.
349

350
350
350
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,555
350
You know I don't like that, Rose.
350

351
351
351
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,279
351
She knows.
351

352
352
352
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,474
352
We'll both have the lamb.
352
Rare, with very little mint sauce.
352

353
353
353
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,437
353
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?
353

354
354
354
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:45,514
354
Sausage.
354

355
355
355
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:49,279
355
You gonna cut her meat for her,
355
too, there, Cal?
355

356
356
356
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,884
356
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?
356

357
357
357
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:57,034
357
- Was it you, Bruce?
357
- Yes, actually.
357

358
358
358
00:32:57,805 --> 00:33:00,159
358
I wanted to convey sheer size.
358

359
359
359
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:02,958
359
And size means stability, luxury ...
359

360
360
360
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:05,235
360
and above all, strength.
360

361
361
361
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,553
361
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?
361

362
362
362
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,999
362
His ideas about
362
the male preoccupation with size ...
362

363
363
363
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,439
363
might be of particular interest to you.
363

364
364
364
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,881
364
What's gotten into you?
364

365
365
365
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,158
365
Excuse me.
365

366
366
366
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:22,917
366
I do apologize.
366

367
367
367
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,837
367
She's a pistol, Cal.
367
Hope you can handle her.
367

368
368
368
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,353
368
I may have to start minding
368
what she reads from now on ...
368

369
369
369
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,797
369
won't I, Mrs. Brown?
369

370
370
370
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:32,352
370
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?
370

371
371
371
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,239
371
The ship is nice?
371

372
372
372
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,881
372
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.
372

373
373
373
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:49,282
373
Is English, no?
373

374
374
374
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:52,002
374
No, it was built in Ireland.
374
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.
374

375
375
375
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,472
375
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.
375

376
376
376
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,602
376
Well, that's typical.
376

377
377
377
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,436
377
First-class dogs come down here
377
to take a shit.
377

378
378
378
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,196
378
Lets us know where we rank
378
in the scheme of things.
378

379
379
379
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:04,000
379
Like we could forget.
379

380
380
380
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:06,601
380
I'm Tommy Ryan.
380

381
381
381
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:08,081
381
- Jack Dawson.
381
- Hello.
381

382
382
382
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:09,641
382
- Fabrizio.
382
- Hi.
382

383
383
383
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,076
383
Do you make any money
383
with your drawings?
383

384
384
384
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,555
384
Forget it, boyo.
384

385
385
385
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:26,313
385
You'd as like have angels
385
fly out of your arse ...
385

386
386
386
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:28,631
386
as get next to the likes of her.
386

387
387
387
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:54,151
387
I saw my whole life
387
as if I'd already lived it.
387

388
388
388
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,952
388
An endless parade of parties
388
and cotillions ...
388

389
389
389
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,352
389
yachts and polo matches.
389

390
390
390
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:05,000
390
Always the same narrow people,
390
the same mindless chatter.
390

391
391
391
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:09,152
391
I felt like I was standing at
391
a great precipice ...
391

392
392
392
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,230
392
with no one to pull me back.
392

393
393
393
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,198
393
No one who cared ...
393

394
394
394
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,153
394
or even noticed.
394

395
395
395
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:04,196
395
Don't do it.
395

396
396
396
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:05,951
396
Stay back.
396

397
397
397
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:08,669
397
Don't come any closer.
397

398
398
398
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:12,030
398
Come on. Just give me your hand,
398
I'll pull you back over.
398

399
399
399
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:13,947
399
No! Stay where you are.
399

400
400
400
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:15,796
400
I mean it.
400

401
401
401
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:17,675
401
I'll let go.
401

402
402
402
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:29,909
402
No, you won't.
402

403
403
403
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,152
403
What do you mean, no I won't?
403

404
404
404
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:37,150
404
Don't presume to tell me what I will
404
and will not do. You don't know me.
404

405
405
405
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:39,704
405
Well, you would have done it already.
405

406
406
406
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,150
406
You're distracting me. Go away.
406

407
407
407
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:44,307
407
I can't. I'm involved now.
407

408
408
408
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:48,508
408
You let go, and I'm gonna have
408
to jump in there after you.
408

409
409
409
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,034
409
Don't be absurd.
409

410
410
410
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,943
410
- You'll be killed.
410
- I'm a good swimmer.
410

411
411
411
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,866
411
The fall alone will kill you.
411

412
412
412
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,594
412
It would hurt.
412
I'm not saying it wouldn't.
412

413
413
413
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,186
413
To tell you the truth,
413
I'm a lot more concerned ...
413

414
414
414
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,345
414
about that water being so cold.
414

415
415
415
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,749
415
How cold?
415

416
416
416
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,713
416
Freezing.
416
Maybe a couple of degrees over.
416

417
417
417
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:23,062
417
You ever ...
417
You ever been to Wisconsin?
417

418
418
418
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:27,709
418
What?
418

419
419
419
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:30,547
419
They have some of the coldest
419
winters around.
419

420
420
420
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,989
420
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.
420

421
421
421
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:36,191
421
I remember, when I was a kid,
421
me and my father ...
421

422
422
422
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,782
422
we went ice fishing
422
out on Lake Wissota.
422

423
423
423
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:42,989
423
- Ice fishing is, you know, where you —
423
- I know what ice fishing is.
423

424
424
424
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:44,863
424
Sorry.
424

425
425
425
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:49,471
425
You just seem like,
425
you know, kind of an indoor girl.
425

426
426
426
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:52,621
426
Anyway, I ...
426

427
427
427
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,703
427
I fell through some thin ice.
427

428
428
428
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,385
428
And I'm telling you ...
428

429
429
429
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,185
429
water that cold ...
429

430
430
430
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,344
430
like right down there ...
430

431
431
431
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:06,792
431
it hits you like a 1,000 knives
431
stabbing you all over your body.
431

432
432
432
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:10,191
432
You can't breathe. You can't think.
432

433
433
433
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:14,227
433
Least, not about anything but the pain.
433

434
434
434
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:20,542
434
Which is why I'm not looking forward
434
to jumping in there after you.
434

435
435
435
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:22,706
435
Like I said ...
435

436
436
436
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,389
436
I don't have a choice.
436

437
437
437
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:32,024
437
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
437
come back over the rail an ...
437

438
438
438
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:33,909
438
and get me off the hook here.
438

439
439
439
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:35,665
439
You're crazy.
439

440
440
440
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,903
440
That's what everybody says bu ...
440

441
441
441
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,183
441
but with all due respect, miss ...
441

442
442
442
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:45,150
442
I'm not the one hanging off
442
the back of a ship here.
442

443
443
443
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:46,866
443
Come on.
443

444
444
444
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,184
444
Give me your hand.
444

445
445
445
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,623
445
You don't want to do this.
445

446
446
446
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,189
446
I'm Jack Dawson.
446

447
447
447
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,508
447
Rose Dewitt Bukater.
447

448
448
448
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,424
448
I'll have to get you
448
to write that one down.
448

449
449
449
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,745
449
Come on.
449

450
450
450
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,623
450
I got you. Come on.
450

451
451
451
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,624
451
Come on!
451

452
452
452
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,429
452
Help, please!
452

453
453
453
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,307
453
- Please, help me!
453
- Listen to me. I've got you.
453

454
454
454
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,069
454
I won't let go.
454

455
455
455
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,266
455
Now pull yourself up. Come on!
455

456
456
456
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,787
456
Come on. That's right.
456

457
457
457
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,863
457
You can do it.
457

458
458
458
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,509
458
I got you.
458

459
459
459
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:00,467
459
What's all this?
459

460
460
460
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:08,463
460
You stand back!
460
And don't move an inch!
460

461
461
461
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,268
461
Fetch the master-at-arms.
461

462
462
462
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,499
462
This is completely unacceptable.
462

463
463
463
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,304
463
What made you think you could
463
put your hands on my fiancée?
463

464
464
464
00:41:20,669 --> 00:41:22,261
464
Look at me, you filth!
464

465
465
465
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,385
465
- Cal.
465
- What do you think you were doing?
465

466
466
466
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,584
466
Cal, stop. It was an accident.
466

467
467
467
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,061
467
An accident?
467

468
468
468
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,858
468
It was.
468

469
469
469
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:33,427
469
Stupid, really.
469

470
470
470
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,783
470
I was leaning over and I slipped.
470

471
471
471
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:40,822
471
I was leaning far over to see the ...
471

472
472
472
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,584
472
- Propellers?
472
- Propellers, and I slipped.
472

473
473
473
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:51,343
473
And I would have gone overboard,
473
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.
473

474
474
474
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:53,738
474
And almost went over himself.
474

475
475
475
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,025
475
She wanted to see the propellers.
475

476
476
476
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,906
476
Like I said,
476
women and machinery do not mix.
476

477
477
477
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:01,619
477
Was that the way of it?
477

478
478
478
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,303
478
Yeah, that was pretty much it.
478

479
479
479
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:09,299
479
Well, the boy's a hero, then.
479
Good for you, son. Well done.
479

480
480
480
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,425
480
So, it's all's well and
480
back to our brandy, eh?
480
- Aha.
480

481
481
481
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:17,097
481
Look at you. You must be freezing.
481
Let's get you inside.
481

482
482
482
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,741
482
Err ... perhaps a little
482
something for the boy?
482

483
483
483
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:23,821
483
Of course.
483

484
484
484
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:25,620
484
Mr. Lovejoy ...
484

485
485
485
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:27,857
485
I think a 20 should do it.
485

486
486
486
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:31,384
486
Is that the going rate
486
for saving the woman you love?
486

487
487
487
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:33,819
487
Rose is displeased.
487

488
488
488
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,825
488
What to do?
488

489
489
489
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:37,621
489
I know.
489

490
490
490
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:42,982
490
Perhaps you could join us
490
for dinner tomorrow evening.
490

491
491
491
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,897
491
To regale our group
491
with your heroic tale.
491

492
492
492
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,298
492
Sure. Count me in.
492

493
493
493
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:53,697
493
Good. It's settled then.
493

494
494
494
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,102
494
This should be interesting.
494

495
495
495
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,335
495
Can I bum a smoke?
495

496
496
496
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,341
496
You'll want to tie those.
496

497
497
497
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:23,142
497
It's interesting.
497
The young lady slipped so suddenly ...
497

498
498
498
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:26,735
498
and you still had time to remove
498
your jacket and your shoes.
498

499
499
499
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:44,134
499
I know you've been melancholy.
499

500
500
500
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:47,215
500
I don't pretend to know why.
500

501
501
501
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:51,535
501
I intended to save this ...
501

502
502
502
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:56,300
502
until the engagement gala next week.
502

503
503
503
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:01,936
503
But I thought, tonight.
503

504
504
504
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:04,183
504
Good gracious!
504

505
505
505
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:07,736
505
Perhaps as a reminder
505
of my feelings for you.
505

506
506
506
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,020
506
- Is it a —
506
- Diamond? Yes.
506

507
507
507
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,972
507
56 carats to be exact.
507

508
508
508
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,374
508
It was worn by Louis XVI.
508

509
509
509
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:22,692
509
And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer".
509

510
510
510
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:26,093
510
- The "Heart of the Ocean".
510
- The "Heart of the Ocean". Yes.
510

511
511
511
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:32,701
511
It's overwhelming.
511

512
512
512
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:34,780
512
It's for royalty.
512

513
513
513
00:44:35,863 --> 00:44:37,614
513
We are royalty, Rose.
513

514
514
514
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:44,660
514
You know, there is nothing
514
I couldn't give you.
514

515
515
515
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:46,858
515
There is nothing I'd deny you ...
515

516
516
516
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:49,133
516
if you would not deny me.
516

517
517
517
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:55,532
517
Open your heart to me, Rose.
517

518
518
518
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,972
518
I've been on my own since I was 15.
518

519
519
519
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,734
519
Since my folks died.
519

520
520
520
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:19,210
520
And I had no brothers or sisters
520
or close kin in that part of the country.
520

521
521
521
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,414
521
So I lit on out of there
521
and I haven't been back since.
521

522
522
522
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,732
522
You can just call me
522
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.
522

523
523
523
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:31,495
523
Well, Rose, we've walked
523
about a mile around this boat deck ...
523

524
524
524
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:35,418
524
chewed over how great
524
the weather's been and how I grew up ...
524

525
525
525
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:39,216
525
but I reckon that's not
525
why you came to talk to me, is it?
525

526
526
526
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,013
526
- Mr. Dawson, I —
526
- Jack.
526

527
527
527
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,329
527
Jack ...
527

528
528
528
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,248
528
I want to thank you for what you did.
528

529
529
529
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,059
529
Not just for pulling me back ...
529

530
530
530
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,333
530
- but for your discretion.
530
- You're welcome.
530

531
531
531
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,089
531
Look ...
531

532
532
532
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,009
532
I know what you must be thinking:
532

533
533
533
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,810
533
"Poor little rich girl.
533
What does she know about misery?"
533

534
534
534
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,489
534
No.
534

535
535
535
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,458
535
That's not what I was thinking.
535

536
536
536
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,293
536
What I was thinking was ...
536

537
537
537
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,055
537
what could have happened to this girl
537
to make her think she had no way out?
537

538
538
538
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:15,979
538
Well, I ...
538

539
539
539
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,253
539
It was everything.
539

540
540
540
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:21,490
540
It was my whole world
540
and all the people in it.
540

541
541
541
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:23,810
541
And the inertia of my life ...
541

542
542
542
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,977
542
plunging ahead,
542
and me, powerless to stop it.
542

543
543
543
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,536
543
God, look at that thing.
543

544
544
544
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,253
544
You'd have gone straight
544
to the bottom.
544

545
545
545
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:36,213
545
500 invitations have gone out.
545

546
546
546
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:38,972
546
All of Philadelphia society
546
will be there.
546

547
547
547
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:41,368
547
And all the while, I feel I'm  ...
547

548
548
548
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:43,654
548
standing in the middle of
548
a crowded room ...
548

549
549
549
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,697
549
screaming at the top of my lungs,
549
and no one even looks up.
549

550
550
550
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:49,612
550
Do you love him?
550

551
551
551
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,652
551
Pardon me?
551

552
552
552
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:53,251
552
Do you love him?
552

553
553
553
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:56,849
553
You're being very rude.
553
You shouldn't be asking me this.
553

554
554
554
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:00,055
554
It's a simple question.
554
Do you love the guy or not?
554

555
555
555
00:47:01,658 --> 00:47:03,614
555
This is not a suitable conversation.
555

556
556
556
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:06,258
556
Why can't you
556
just answer the question?
556

557
557
557
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:08,977
557
This is absurd.
557

558
558
558
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,935
558
You don't know me
558
and I don't know you ...
558

559
559
559
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:13,452
559
and we are not having
559
this conversation at all.
559

560
560
560
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:16,336
560
You are rude and uncouth
560
and presumptuous and ...
560

561
561
561
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,771
561
I am leaving now.
561

562
562
562
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:20,417
562
Jack, Mr. Dawson,
562
it's been a pleasure.
562

563
563
563
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,887
563
I sought you out to thank you
563
and now I have thanked you —
563

564
564
564
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:24,774
564
And you've insulted me.
564

565
565
565
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:26,455
565
Well, you deserved it.
565

566
566
566
00:47:26,537 --> 00:47:27,970
566
- Right.
566
- Right.
566

567
567
567
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:33,092
567
- I thought you were leaving.
567
- I am.
567

568
568
568
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:37,455
568
You are so annoying.
568

569
569
569
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,567
569
Wait, I don't have to leave.
569

570
570
570
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,251
570
This is my part of the ship.
570
You leave.
570

571
571
571
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:46,611
571
Well, well, well!
571
Now who's being rude?
571

572
572
572
00:47:50,697 --> 00:47:53,733
572
What is this stupid thing
572
you're carrying around?
572

573
573
573
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:57,255
573
So, what are you,
573
an artist or something?
573

574
574
574
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:02,733
574
These are rather good.
574

575
575
575
00:48:05,656 --> 00:48:08,454
575
They're — they're very good, actually.
575

576
576
576
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,527
576
Jack, this is exquisite work.
576

577
577
577
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:20,335
577
They didn't think too much
577
of them in old Paree.
577

578
578
578
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:21,484
578
Paris?
578

579
579
579
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,926
579
You do get around for a ...
579

580
580
580
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,091
580
Well, a person of limited means.
580

581
581
581
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,450
581
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.
581

582
582
582
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,373
582
Well, well, well.
582

583
583
583
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:44,050
583
And these were drawn from life?
583

584
584
584
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:48,805
584
That's one of the good things
584
about Paris.
584

585
585
585
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,852
585
Lots of girls willing to take
585
their clothes off.
585

586
586
586
00:48:56,815 --> 00:48:58,567
586
You liked this woman.
586

587
587
587
00:48:58,815 --> 00:49:00,805
587
You used her several times.
587

588
588
588
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:06,003
588
Well, she had beautiful hands,
588
you see?
588

589
589
589
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:10,244
589
I think you must have had
589
a love affair with her.
589

590
590
590
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,564
590
No, no, no, no — just with her hands.
590

591
591
591
00:49:13,094 --> 00:49:15,369
591
She was a one-legged prostitute.
591

592
592
592
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,643
592
See?
592

593
593
593
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:26,293
593
She had a good sense of humor, though.
593

594
594
594
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,846
594
And this lady ...
594

595
595
595
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,247
595
she used to sit
595
at this bar every night ...
595

596
596
596
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,847
596
wearing every piece of jewelry
596
she owned just ...
596

597
597
597
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:38,367
597
waiting for her long lost love.
597

598
598
598
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:40,889
598
We called her Madame Bijoux.
598

599
599
599
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:43,727
599
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.
599

600
600
600
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:47,043
600
Well, you have a gift, Jack.
600

601
601
601
00:49:47,853 --> 00:49:48,968
601
You do.
601

602
602
602
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:52,332
602
- You see people.
602
- I see you.
602

603
603
603
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:55,767
603
And?
603

604
604
604
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,489
604
You wouldn't have jumped.
604

605
605
605
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:06,761
605
But the purpose of university
605
is to find a suitable husband.
605

606
606
606
00:50:07,012 --> 00:50:08,968
606
Rose has already done that.
606

607
607
607
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,725
607
Look, here comes that vulgar
607
"Brown" woman.
607

608
608
608
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:14,571
608
Quickly, get up
608
before she sits with us.
608

609
609
609
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,126
609
Hello, girls.
609
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.
609

610
610
610
00:50:18,212 --> 00:50:20,282
610
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.
610

611
611
611
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:23,330
611
The Countess and I were just off
611
to take the air on the boat deck.
611

612
612
612
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:26,563
612
What a lovely idea.
612
I need to catch up on my gossip.
612

613
613
613
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:30,880
613
Countess.
613

614
614
614
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,004
614
You've not yet lit
614
the last 4 boilers?
614

615
615
615
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:37,248
615
No, I don't see the need.
615

616
616
616
00:50:37,331 --> 00:50:39,367
616
We are making excellent time.
616

617
617
617
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,922
617
The press knows the size of Titanic.
617

618
618
618
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:44,320
618
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.
618

619
619
619
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:47,050
619
We must give them
619
something new to print.
619

620
620
620
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:51,688
620
This maiden voyage of Titanic
620
must make headlines.
620

621
621
621
00:50:52,811 --> 00:50:54,210
621
Mr. Ismay ...
621

622
622
622
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:59,323
622
I would prefer not to push the engines
622
until they've been properly run in.
622

623
623
623
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,604
623
Of course, I'm just a passenger.
623

624
624
624
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,329
624
I leave it to your good offices
624
to decide what's best.
624

625
625
625
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,004
625
But what a glorious end
625
to your final crossing ...
625

626
626
626
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:10,366
626
if we were to get into New York
626
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.
626

627
627
627
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,327
627
Make the morning papers.
627

628
628
628
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,560
628
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
628

629
629
629
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,358
629
Good man.
629

630
630
630
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,890
630
Well, after that, I worked
630
on a squid boat in Monterey,
630

631
631
631
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,243
631
then I went down to Los Angeles
631
to the pier in Santa Monica ...
631

632
632
632
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,606
632
and started doing portraits there
632
for 10 cents a piece.
632

633
633
633
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,886
633
Why can't I be like you, Jack?
633

634
634
634
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,245
634
Just head out for the horizon
634
whenever I feel like it.
634

635
635
635
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,927
635
Say we'll go there sometime,
635
to that pier ...
635

636
636
636
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,523
636
even if we only ever
636
just talk about it.
636

637
637
637
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:45,282
637
No, we'll do it.
637
We'll drink cheap beer,
637

638
638
638
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:48,407
638
we'll ride on the roller coaster
638
till we throw up.
638

639
639
639
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:51,561
639
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
639
right in the surf.
639

640
640
640
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:55,642
640
But you'll have to do it like a real
640
cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
640

641
641
641
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:58,483
641
- You mean, one leg on each side?
641
- Yeah.
641

642
642
642
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:02,443
642
- Can you show me?
642
- Sure, if you like.
642

643
643
643
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:06,200
643
Teach me to ride like a man.
643

644
644
644
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,165
644
And chew tobacco like a man.
644

645
645
645
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:10,726
645
And spit like a man.
645

646
646
646
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:13,197
646
What, they didn't teach you that
646
in finishing school?
646

647
647
647
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:14,277
647
No.
647

648
648
648
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:17,124
648
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.
648

649
649
649
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,561
649
I'll show you how, come on.
649

650
650
650
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:20,445
650
- Jack, no.
650
- Come on.
650

651
651
651
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,405
651
- No. Wait, Jack.
651
- Come on.
651

652
652
652
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:24,958
652
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.
652

653
653
653
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:26,481
653
Watch closely.
653

654
654
654
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,040
654
That's disgusting.
654

655
655
655
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,006
655
All right, your turn.
655

656
656
656
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,682
656
That was pitiful.
656
Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.
656

657
657
657
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,327
657
Get some leverage to it,
657
use your arms ...
657

658
658
658
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,841
658
arc your neck.
658

659
659
659
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:42,837
659
You see the range on that thing?
659

660
660
660
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,760
660
Okay, go.
660

661
661
661
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:50,002
661
- That was better. You got to work on it.
661
- Really?
661

662
662
662
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,796
662
Really try to hawk it up
662
and get some body to it. You gotta ...
662

663
663
663
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:01,556
663
Mother.
663

664
664
664
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,757
664
May I introduce Jack Dawson?
664

665
665
665
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,805
665
Charmed, I'm sure.
665

666
666
666
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,681
666
The others were gracious
666
and curious ...
666

667
667
667
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:21,075
667
about the man who'd saved my life.
667

668
668
668
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,885
668
But my mother looked at him
668
like an insect.
668

669
669
669
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,995
669
A dangerous insect
669
which must be squashed quickly.
669

670
670
670
00:53:29,646 --> 00:53:33,639
670
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
670
to have around in a sticky spot.
670

671
671
671
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,355
671
Why do they always insist on
671
announcing dinner ...
671

672
672
672
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:40,436
672
like a damn cavalry charge?
672

673
673
673
00:53:40,806 --> 00:53:42,796
673
Shall we go dress, Mother?
673

674
674
674
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:45,322
674
See you at dinner, Jack.
674

675
675
675
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:48,280
675
Son?
675

676
676
676
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:49,600
676
Son!
676

677
677
677
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:53,522
677
Do you have the slightest comprehension
677
of what you're doing?
677

678
678
678
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,640
678
Not really.
678

679
679
679
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:57,193
679
You're about to go into the snake pit.
679

680
680
680
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:01,435
680
What are you planning to wear?
680

681
681
681
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:05,677
681
I figured. Come on.
681

682
682
682
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,804
682
I was right.
682

683
683
683
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,673
683
You and my son
683
are just about the same size.
683

684
684
684
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:14,163
684
Pretty close.
684

685
685
685
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,120
685
You shine up like a new penny.
685

686
686
686
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,196
686
Good evening, sir.
686

687
687
687
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:37,679
687
There are several thousand tons
687
of Hockley steel in this very ship.
687

688
688
688
00:55:37,762 --> 00:55:39,957
688
- Which part?
688
- All the right ones, of course.
688

689
689
689
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:42,431
689
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
689
if there's a problem.
689

690
690
690
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,672
690
- Where's my daughter?
690
- She'll be along.
690

691
691
691
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:46,514
691
There is the Countess.
691

692
692
692
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,394
692
- Hello, my dear.
692
- Good evening, Cal.
692

693
693
693
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:50,278
693
So good to see you.
693

694
694
694
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:18,270
694
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
694
and I always wanted to do it.
694

695
695
695
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,392
695
I'll see you at dinner.
695

696
696
696
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,994
696
Darling ...
696

697
697
697
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,555
697
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
697

698
698
698
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,114
698
Dawson.
698

699
699
699
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,599
699
That's amazing.
699

700
700
700
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,474
700
You could almost pass
700
for a gentleman.
700

701
701
701
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,994
701
Almost.
701

702
702
702
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,798
702
Extraordinary.
702

703
703
703
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,593
703
My dear, it's delightful to see you.
703

704
704
704
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,993
704
What a remarkable voyage this is.
704

705
705
705
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,547
705
- It's mad, isn't it?
705
- Completely lunatic.
705

706
706
706
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:06,749
706
There's the Countess of Rothes.
706

707
707
707
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,669
707
And that's John Jacob Astor ...
707

708
708
708
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,677
708
the richest man on the ship.
708

709
709
709
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:17,593
709
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
709
is my age, and in a delicate condition.
709

710
710
710
00:57:18,399 --> 00:57:20,151
710
See how she's trying to hide it?
710

711
711
711
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,797
711
Quite the scandal.
711

712
712
712
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:25,669
712
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
712
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.
712

713
713
713
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:28,875
713
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
713
with the children, of course.
713

714
714
714
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:32,348
714
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
714
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.
714

715
715
715
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:35,669
715
She designs naughty lingerie,
715
among her many talents.
715

716
716
716
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:38,114
716
Very popular with the royals.
716

717
717
717
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,392
717
Congratulations, Hockley.
717
She's splendid.
717

718
718
718
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:42,911
718
Why, thank you.
718

719
719
719
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:46,276
719
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
719
- Certainly.
719

720
720
720
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,277
720
Sweet pea?
720

721
721
721
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:53,475
721
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?
721
Remember, they love money.
721

722
722
722
00:57:53,558 --> 00:57:56,675
722
So just pretend like you own a
722
gold mine and you're in the club.
722

723
723
723
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:00,305
723
Hey, Astor.
723

724
724
724
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:03,627
724
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.
724

725
725
725
00:58:04,157 --> 00:58:06,671
725
J.J., Madeleine,
725
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.
725

726
726
726
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:08,190
726
- How do you do?
726
- Pleasure.
726

727
727
727
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,710
727
Well, Jack ...
727

728
728
728
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:12,233
728
are you of the Boston Dawsons?
728

729
729
729
00:58:12,677 --> 00:58:15,271
729
No, the Chippewa Falls
729
Dawsons, actually.
729

730
730
730
00:58:15,357 --> 00:58:16,506
730
Oh, yes.
730

731
731
731
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:21,634
731
He must have been nervous,
731
but he never faltered.
731

732
732
732
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:25,267
732
They assumed he was one of them.
732

733
733
733
00:58:25,357 --> 00:58:27,951
733
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.
733

734
734
734
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:32,187
734
New money, obviously,
734
but still a member of the club.
734

735
735
735
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:36,633
735
Mother, of course,
735
could always be counted upon.
735

736
736
736
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:40,434
736
Tell us of the accommodations
736
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.
736

737
737
737
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:42,234
737
I hear they're quite good
737
on this ship.
737

738
738
738
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:46,389
738
The best I've seen, ma'am.
738
Hardly any rats.
738

739
739
739
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:52,315
739
Mr. Dawson is joining us
739
from the third class.
739

740
740
740
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:54,785
740
He was of some assistance
740
to my fiancée last night.
740

741
741
741
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,629
741
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
741
is quite a fine artist.
741

742
742
742
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,708
742
He was kind enough to show me
742
some of his work today.
742

743
743
743
00:59:00,796 --> 00:59:03,788
743
Rose and I differ somewhat
743
in our definition of fine art.
743

744
744
744
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:05,945
744
Not to impugn your work, sir.
744

745
745
745
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,029
745
Are these all for me?
745

746
746
746
00:59:17,115 --> 00:59:19,106
746
Just start from the outside
746
and work your way in.
746

747
747
747
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:21,470
747
He knows every rivet in her,
747
don't you, Thomas?
747

748
748
748
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:24,023
748
Your ship is a wonder,
748
Mr. Andrews. Truly.
748

749
749
749
00:59:24,115 --> 00:59:25,628
749
Thank you, Rose.
749

750
750
750
00:59:28,475 --> 00:59:29,954
750
How do you take your caviar, sir?
750

751
751
751
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:31,831
751
No caviar for me, thanks.
751

752
752
752
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,746
752
Never did like it much.
752

753
753
753
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:37,667
753
And where exactly do you live,
753
Mr. Dawson?
753

754
754
754
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:40,632
754
Right now, my address
754
is the RMS Titanic.
754

755
755
755
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:43,424
755
After that, I'm on God's good humor.
755

756
756
756
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:46,074
756
And how is it you have means to travel?
756

757
757
757
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:48,270
757
I work my way from place to place.
757

758
758
758
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,549
758
You know, tramp steamers and such.
758

759
759
759
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:54,024
759
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
759
at a lucky hand at poker.
759

760
760
760
00:59:54,154 --> 00:59:55,746
760
A very lucky hand.
760

761
761
761
00:59:56,474 --> 00:59:58,510
761
All life is a game of luck.
761

762
762
762
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:02,507
762
A real man makes his own luck,
762
Archie. Right, Dawson?
762

763
763
763
01:00:03,954 --> 01:00:07,662
763
And you find that sort of rootless
763
existence appealing, do you?
763

764
764
764
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:12,185
764
Yes, ma'am, I do.
764

765
765
765
01:00:12,793 --> 01:00:15,910
765
I mean, I've got everything I need
765
right here with me.
765

766
766
766
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:19,303
766
I got air in my lungs
766
and a few blank sheets of paper.
766

767
767
767
01:00:19,913 --> 01:00:23,110
767
I love waking up in the morning
767
not knowing what's gonna happen ...
767

768
768
768
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,230
768
or who I'm gonna meet ...
768

769
769
769
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:27,031
769
where I'm gonna wind up.
769

770
770
770
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:29,752
770
Just the other night I was sleeping
770
under a bridge, and now ...
770

771
771
771
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,983
771
here I am on the grandest
771
ship in the world ...
771

772
772
772
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:33,711
772
having champagne with you fine people.
772

773
773
773
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,590
773
I'll take some more of that.
773

774
774
774
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:39,507
774
I figure life is a gift
774
and I don't intend on wasting it.
774

775
775
775
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:42,547
775
You never know what hand
775
you're gonna get dealt next.
775

776
776
776
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:44,782
776
You learn to take life
776
as it comes at you.
776

777
777
777
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:46,385
777
Here you go, Cal.
777

778
778
778
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:49,589
778
To make each day count.
778

779
779
779
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,388
779
- Well said, Jack.
779
- Hear, hear.
779

780
780
780
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,150
780
To making it count.
780

781
781
781
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:57,984
781
To making it count!
781

782
782
782
01:00:58,592 --> 01:00:59,741
782
Bravo.
782

783
783
783
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:09,421
783
But Mr. Brown had no idea
783
I'd hidden the money in the stove.
783

784
784
784
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:14,585
784
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
784
celebrating, and he lights a fire.
784

785
785
785
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:18,186
785
Bravo.
785

786
786
786
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,910
786
Next it'll be brandies
786
in the smoking room.
786

787
787
787
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:25,343
787
- Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
787
- What a good idea.
787

788
788
788
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:29,022
788
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
788
and congratulate each other ...
788

789
789
789
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:30,703
789
on being masters of the universe.
789

790
790
790
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,669
790
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
790
of your company.
790

791
791
791
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,309
791
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?
791

792
792
792
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,063
792
No, I'll stay here.
792

793
793
793
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:38,943
793
Here you go, Molly.
793

794
794
794
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,149
794
Joining us, Dawson?
794

795
795
795
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,427
795
You don't want to stay out here
795
with the women, do you?
795

796
796
796
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,786
796
- No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.
796
- Probably best.
796

797
797
797
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,259
797
It'll be all business and politics,
797
that sort of thing.
797

798
798
798
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,147
798
Wouldn't interest you.
798

799
799
799
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,709
799
But, Dawson ...
799

800
800
800
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,828
800
good of you to come.
800

801
801
801
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,703
801
Jack, must you go?
801

802
802
802
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,588
802
Time for me to go row
802
with the other slaves.
802

803
803
803
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,822
803
Good night, Rose.
803

804
804
804
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:49,383
804
So you want to go to a real party?
804

805
805
805
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:02,022
805
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.
805

806
806
806
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:17,617
806
What?
806

807
807
807
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:22,024
807
I can't understand you.
807

808
808
808
01:03:53,146 --> 01:03:55,580
808
I'm going to dance
808
with her now, all right?
808

809
809
809
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,815
809
Come on.
809

810
810
810
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,339
810
- What?
810
- Come on.
810

811
811
811
01:03:58,426 --> 01:04:00,735
811
- Come with me.
811
- Jack! Jack, wait.
811

812
812
812
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:04,540
812
I can't do this.
812

813
813
813
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:07,936
813
We're gonna have to get
813
a little bit closer, like this.
813

814
814
814
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:12,981
814
You're still my best girl, Cora.
814

815
815
815
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,777
815
- I don't know the steps.
815
- Neither do I, just go with it.
815

816
816
816
01:04:18,866 --> 01:04:20,219
816
Don't think.
816

817
817
817
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:41,144
817
Wait, Jack! Stop!
817

818
818
818
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,904
818
Stop! Wait!
818

819
819
819
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:33,295
819
Jack, no.
819

820
820
820
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:41,014
820
... beyond the jurisdiction
820
of the Sherman Act.
820

821
821
821
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,741
821
So my lawyers will argue.
821

822
822
822
01:05:42,823 --> 01:05:46,179
822
That's what Rockefeller said, but
822
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.
822

823
823
823
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:06,651
823
What?
823

824
824
824
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:09,415
824
You think a first-class girl
824
can't drink?
824

825
825
825
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:12,975
825
Get out of here.
825

826
826
826
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:14,620
826
You all right?
826

827
827
827
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,297
827
I'm fine.
827

828
828
828
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:18,940
828
2 out of 3.
828

829
829
829
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,377
829
So ...
829

830
830
830
01:06:22,622 --> 01:06:24,852
830
you think you're big tough men?
830

831
831
831
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:27,538
831
Let's see you do this.
831

832
832
832
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:31,690
832
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.
832

833
833
833
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,539
833
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
833

834
834
834
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:53,658
834
- Are you all right?
834
- I haven't done that in years.
834

835
835
835
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,773
835
Coffee, sir?
835

836
836
836
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,813
836
I had hoped you would come to me
836
last night.
836

837
837
837
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:44,298
837
I was tired.
837

838
838
838
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,369
838
Your exertions below decks were,
838
no doubt, exhausting.
838

839
839
839
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:56,133
839
I see you had that undertaker
839
of a manservant follow me. How typical.
839

840
840
840
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:59,973
840
You will never behave like that again,
840
Rose, do you understand?
840

841
841
841
01:08:02,218 --> 01:08:05,767
841
I'm not a foreman in one of
841
your mills that you can command.
841

842
842
842
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:08,296
842
I'm your fiancée.
842

843
843
843
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,456
843
My fiancée!
843

844
844
844
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,689
844
Yes, you are, and my wife!
844

845
845
845
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:19,377
845
My wife in practice, if not yet
845
by law. So you will honor me.
845

846
846
846
01:08:19,858 --> 01:08:22,850
846
You'll honor me the way a wife
846
is required to honor her husband.
846

847
847
847
01:08:22,938 --> 01:08:25,657
847
Because I will not be made
847
out a fool, Rose.
847

848
848
848
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,729
848
Is this in any way unclear?
848

849
849
849
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:29,487
849
No.
849

850
850
850
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,173
850
Good. Excuse me.
850

851
851
851
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:38,852
851
Miss Rose.
851

852
852
852
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,177
852
- We had a little accident.
852
- That's all right, Miss Rose.
852

853
853
853
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:44,849
853
- Sorry, Trudy.
853
- It's all right.
853

854
854
854
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:46,211
854
Let me help you.
854

855
855
855
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:48,015
855
It's all right, miss.
855

856
856
856
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:55,216
856
It's all right, miss.
856

857
857
857
01:09:00,897 --> 01:09:03,286
857
- Tea, Trudy.
857
- Yes, ma'am.
857

858
858
858
01:09:18,816 --> 01:09:21,967
858
You are not to see that boy again.
858
Do you understand me?
858

859
859
859
01:09:23,136 --> 01:09:25,411
859
Rose, I forbid it.
859

860
860
860
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:29,493
860
Stop it, Mother.
860
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.
860

861
861
861
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:31,248
861
This is not a game.
861

862
862
862
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,766
862
Our situation is precarious.
862

863
863
863
01:09:33,856 --> 01:09:35,335
863
You know the money's gone.
863

864
864
864
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,452
864
Of course I know it's gone.
864

865
865
865
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:39,813
865
You remind me every day.
865

866
866
866
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:45,086
866
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
866
of bad debts hidden by a good name.
866

867
867
867
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:48,294
867
That name is the only card
867
we have to play.
867

868
868
868
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:50,606
868
I don't understand you.
868

869
869
869
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:54,570
869
It is a fine match with Hockley.
869
It will ensure our survival.
869

870
870
870
01:09:56,135 --> 01:09:58,012
870
How can you put this on my shoulders?
870

871
871
871
01:09:58,095 --> 01:09:59,813
871
Why are you being so selfish?
871

872
872
872
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,487
872
I'm being selfish?
872

873
873
873
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:07,773
873
Do you want to see me working
873
as a seamstress?
873

874
874
874
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,251
874
Is that what you want?
874

875
875
875
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:16,248
875
To see our fine things
875
sold at auction?
875

876
876
876
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,483
876
Our memories scattered to the winds?
876

877
877
877
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:32,092
877
It's so unfair.
877

878
878
878
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:35,571
878
Of course it's unfair.
878

879
879
879
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:37,853
879
We're women.
879

880
880
880
01:10:40,294 --> 01:10:42,330
880
Our choices are never easy.

01:11:38,372 --> 01:11:40,681
888
- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
888
- Hello, Jack.
888

889
889
889
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,202
889
I just need to talk to somebody
889
for a second.
889

890
890
890
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:54,647
890
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
890
- I just need to speak to someone.
890

891
891
891
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,522
891
I was just here last night,
891
you don't remember me?
891

892
892
892
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:00,646
892
No, I'm afraid I don't.
892

893
893
893
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:03,199
893
- Now, you're gonna have to turn around.
893
- He'll tell you.
893

894
894
894
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,644
894
I just need to talk —
894

895
895
895
01:12:04,731 --> 01:12:07,450
895
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater ...
895

896
896
896
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:10,725
896
continue to be appreciative
896
of your assistance.
896

897
897
897
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:14,487
897
They asked me to give you this
897
in gratitude.
897

898
898
898
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:16,243
898
I don't want your money. Please.
898
I just —
898

899
899
899
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:19,447
899
Also to remind you
899
that you hold a third-class ticket ...
899

900
900
900
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:22,283
900
and that your presence here
900
is no longer appropriate.
900

901
901
901
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,406
901
Please, I just wanna speak
901
to Rose for one second.
901

902
902
902
01:12:24,491 --> 01:12:28,199
902
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
902
gets back to where he belongs ...
902

903
903
903
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,167
903
and that he stays there.
903

904
904
904
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:32,521
904
Yes, sir. Come along, you.
904

01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:37,529
905

906

907
907
907
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,486

And why do you have
907
2 steering wheels?
907

908
908
908
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,004
908
- We really only use this near shore.
908
- Excuse me, sir.
908

909
909
909
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,650
909
Another ice warning.
909
This one is from the Noordam.
909

910
910
910
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,367
910
Thank you, Sparks.
910

911
911
911
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:57,679
911
Not to worry.
911
Quite normal for this time of year.
911

912
912
912
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:02,003
912
In fact, we're speeding up.
912
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.
912

913
913
913
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,006
913
Okay, son, wind it up tight
913
like I showed you. That's right.
913

914
914
914
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,807
914
Okay, now, let it go.
914

915
915
915
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,281
915
That's excellent.
915

916
916
916
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:24,757
916
Mr. Andrews, forgive me ...
916

917
917
917
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:27,525
917
I did the sum in my head ...
917

918
918
918
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:31,396
918
and with the number of lifeboats
918
times the capacity you mentioned ...
918

919
919
919
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:35,242
919
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
919
not enough for everyone aboard.
919

920
920
920
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,046
920
About half, actually.
920

921
921
921
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:39,963
921
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?
921

922
922
922
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,437
922
In fact, I put in
922
these new-type davits ...
922

923
923
923
01:13:42,528 --> 01:13:45,645
923
which can take an extra row of boats
923
inside this one.
923

924
924
924
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:47,878
924
But it was thought, by some ...
924

925
925
925
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:49,799
925
the deck would look too cluttered.
925

926
926
926
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:51,560
926
So, I was overruled.
926

927
927
927
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:55,359
927
It's a waste of deck space as it is
927
in an unsinkable ship.
927

928
928
928
01:13:55,448 --> 01:13:57,244
928
Sleep soundly, young Rose.
928

929
929
929
01:13:57,328 --> 01:14:00,125
929
I have built you a good ship,
929
strong and true.
929

930
930
930
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,004
930
She's all the lifeboat you need.
930

931
931
931
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:05,159
931
Keep heading aft.
931
The next stop will be the engine room.
931

932
932
932
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:06,396
932
Come on.
932

933
933
933
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:14,325
933
Jack, this is impossible.
933
I can't see you.
933

934
934
934
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:16,682
934
- I need to talk to you.
934
- No, Jack. No.
934

935
935
935
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:20,558
935
Jack, I'm engaged.
935

936
936
936
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:23,405
936
I'm marrying Cal.
936

937
937
937
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:25,646
937
I love Cal.
937

938
938
938
01:14:29,326 --> 01:14:31,681
938
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?
938

939
939
939
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:34,155
939
You're a spoiled little brat, even.
939

940
940
940
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:37,079
940
But under that,
940
you're the most amazingly ...
940

941
941
941
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:39,955
941
astounding, wonderful girl ...
941

942
942
942
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:43,205
942
Woman that I've ever known and —
942

943
943
943
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:45,481
943
- Jack, I —
943
- No, let me try to get this out.
943

944
944
944
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:46,885
944
You're making ...
944

945
945
945
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:52,004
945
I'm not an idiot.
945
I know how the world works.
945

946
946
946
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:53,883
946
I've got $10 in my pocket.
946

947
947
947
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:56,799
947
I have nothing to offer you
947
and I know that.
947

948
948
948
01:14:57,086 --> 01:14:58,485
948
I understand.
948

949
949
949
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:01,442
949
But I'm too involved now.
949

950
950
950
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:03,436
950
You jump, I jump, remember?
950

951
951
951
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:06,801
951
I can't turn away without knowing
951
you'll be all right.
951

952
952
952
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:09,196
952
That's all that I want.
952

953
953
953
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:11,678
953
Well, I'm fine.
953

954
954
954
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:14,556
954
I'll be fine. Really.
954

955
955
955
01:15:15,885 --> 01:15:17,034
955
Really?
955

956
956
956
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:20,477
956
I don't think so.
956

957
957
957
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,198
957
They have got you trapped, Rose.
957

958
958
958
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,276
958
And you're gonna die
958
if you don't break free.
958

959
959
959
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:28,162
959
Maybe not right away,
959
because you're strong ...
959

960
960
960
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,673
960
but sooner or later, that fire
960
that I love about you, Rose ...
960

961
961
961
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:34,880
961
that fire's going to burn out.
961

962
962
962
01:15:39,844 --> 01:15:42,233
962
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
962

963
963
963
01:15:43,564 --> 01:15:44,997
963
You're right.
963

964
964
964
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,836
964
Only you can do that.
964

965
965
965
01:15:53,764 --> 01:15:56,278
965
I'm going back. Leave me alone.
965

966
966
966
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:11,280
966
Tell Lucile about the disaster
966
you had with the stationers.
966

967
967
967
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,002
967
Of course, the invitations had to be
967
sent back, twice.
967

968
968
968
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,961
968
- Oh, my dear.
968
- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.
968

969
969
969
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:19,477
969
Let me tell you,
969
what an odyssey that has been.
969

970
970
970
01:16:19,563 --> 01:16:23,272
970
Rose decided she wanted lavender.
970
She knows I detest the color.
970

971
971
971
01:16:23,363 --> 01:16:25,399
971
She did it to spite me.
971

972
972
972
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,599
972
If only you'd come to me sooner.
972

973
973
973
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,913
973
Ruth saw some of my designs
973
in La Mode lllustrée ...
973

974
974
974
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,152
974
they were for the trousseau ...
974

975
975
975
01:16:31,243 --> 01:16:34,235
975
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest
975
daughter. They were quite charming.
975

976
976
976
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,552
976
I think you'll agree, my dear,
976
that together ...
976

977
977
977
01:16:37,202 --> 01:16:39,921
977
we've created something
977
of a phoenix from the ashes.
977

978
978
978
01:16:54,162 --> 01:16:55,515
978
Hello, Jack.
978

979
979
979
01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:02,394
979
I changed my mind.
979

980
980
980
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:10,438
980
They said you might be up here —
980

981
981
981
01:17:12,121 --> 01:17:13,759
981
Give me your hand.
981

982
982
982
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:22,399
982
Now close your eyes.
982

983
983
983
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,550
983
Go on.
983

984
984
984
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:29,034
984
Now step up.
984

985
985
985
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:35,680
985
Now hold on to the railing.
985
Keep your eyes closed.
985

986
986
986
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:37,479
986
- Don't peek.
986
- I'm not.
986

987
987
987
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,552
987
Step up onto the rail.
987

988
988
988
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,590
988
Hold on. Hold on.
988

989
989
989
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,591
989
Keep your eyes closed.
989

990
990
990
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,753
990
- Do you trust me?
990
- I trust you.
990

991
991
991
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,233
991
All right, open your eyes.
991

992
992
992
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,069
992
I'm flying. Jack.

997
- Incredible.
997

998
998
998
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:42,429
998
There's Smith,
998
and he's standing there ...
998

999
999
999
01:19:42,517 --> 01:19:44,906
999
and he's got the iceberg warning
999
in his fucking hand.
999

1000
1000
1000
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:47,749
1000
Excuse me, his hand,
1000
and he's ordering more speed.
1000

1001
1001
1001
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:50,555
1001
26 years of experience working
1001
against him.
1001

1002
1002
1002
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:55,234
1002
He figures anything big enough to sink
1002
the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.
1002

1003
1003
1003
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:57,955
1003
But the ship's too big
1003
with too small a rudder.
1003

1004
1004
1004
01:19:58,036 --> 01:20:00,106
1004
Doesn't corner worth a damn.
1004

1005
1005
1005
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,666
1005
Everything he knows is wrong.
1005

1006
1006
1006
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:18,346
1006
It's quite proper, I assure you.
1006
This is the sitting room.
1006

1007
1007
1007
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:22,545
1007
- Will this light do?
1007
- What?
1007

1008
1008
1008
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:25,025
1008
Don't artists need good light?
1008

1009
1009
1009
01:20:25,115 --> 01:20:28,790
1009
That is true, but I'm not used to working
1009
in such horrible conditions.
1009

1010
1010
1010
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,064
1010
Monet!
1010

1011
1011
1011
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:34,351
1011
- You know his work?
1011
- Of course.
1011

1012
1012
1012
01:20:34,795 --> 01:20:37,184
1012
Look at his use of color here.
1012
Isn't he great?
1012

1013
1013
1013
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:39,266
1013
I know. It's extraordinary.
1013

1014
1014
1014
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:44,671
1014
Cal insists on carting
1014
this hideous thing everywhere.
1014

1015
1015
1015
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:47,714
1015
Should we be expecting him
1015
anytime soon?
1015

1016
1016
1016
01:20:48,395 --> 01:20:51,272
1016
Not as long as the cigars
1016
and brandy hold out.
1016

1017
1017
1017
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:57,513
1017
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?
1017

1018
1018
1018
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:01,392
1018
A diamond. A very rare diamond.
1018

1019
1019
1019
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:08,669
1019
Jack, I want you to draw me
1019
like one of your French girls.
1019

1020
1020
1020
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:11,594
1020
- Wearing this.
1020
- All right.
1020

1021
1021
1021
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:14,986
1021
Wearing only this.
1021

1022
1022
1022
01:21:48,873 --> 01:21:50,545
1022
The last thing I need ...
1022

1023
1023
1023
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:53,943
1023
is another picture of me
1023
looking like a porcelain doll.
1023

1024
1024
1024
01:21:56,713 --> 01:21:58,623
1024
As a paying customer ...
1024

1025
1025
1025
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:02,382
1025
I expect to get what I want.
1025

1026
1026
1026
01:22:19,552 --> 01:22:22,066
1026
Over on the bed. The couch.
1026

1027
1027
1027
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:32,229
1027
Lie down.
1027

1028
1028
1028
01:22:36,071 --> 01:22:39,700
1028
- Tell me when it looks right.
1028
- Put your arm back the way it was.
1028

1029
1029
1029
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:44,707
1029
Put that other arm up,
1029
that hand right by your face there.
1029

1030
1030
1030
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,260
1030
Right.
1030

1031
1031
1031
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:49,623
1031
Now, head down.
1031

1032
1032
1032
01:22:51,911 --> 01:22:54,027
1032
Eyes to me, keep them on me.
1032

1033
1033
1033
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,783
1033
And try to stay still.
1033

1034
1034
1034
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,309
1034
So serious.
1034

1035
1035
1035
01:23:57,589 --> 01:24:00,422
1035
I believe you are blushing,
1035
Mr. Big Artiste.
1035

1036
1036
1036
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:07,381
1036
I can't imagine
1036
Monsieur Monet blushing.
1036

1037
1037
1037
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:10,260
1037
He does landscapes.
1037

1038
1038
1038
01:24:11,108 --> 01:24:13,383
1038
- Just relax your face.
1038
- Sorry.
1038

1039
1039
1039
01:24:13,468 --> 01:24:14,787
1039
No laughing.
1039

1040
1040
1040
01:24:44,507 --> 01:24:47,021
1040
My heart was pounding the whole time.
1040

1041
1041
1041
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:51,097
1041
It was the most erotic
1041
moment of my life ...
1041

1042
1042
1042
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:56,743
1042
up until then, at least.
1042

1043
1043
1043
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:59,664
1043
So what happened next?
1043

1044
1044
1044
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:02,775
1044
You mean, did we do it?
1044

1045
1045
1045
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:08,138
1045
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.
1045

1046
1046
1046
01:25:08,227 --> 01:25:10,263
1046
Jack was very professional.
1046

1047
1047
1047
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:18,945
1047
Thank you.
1047

1048
1048
1048
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:28,618
1048
What are you doing?
1048

1049
1049
1049
01:25:29,026 --> 01:25:31,779
1049
Will you put this back
1049
in the safe for me?
1049

1050
1050
1050
01:25:42,985 --> 01:25:45,021
1050
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
1050
- Sure.
1050

1051
1051
1051
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:49,414
1051
None of the stewards have seen her.
1051

1052
1052
1052
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:52,260
1052
This is absurd. It's a ship.
1052

1053
1053
1053
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:54,620
1053
There's only so many places
1053
she could be.
1053

1054
1054
1054
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:56,297
1054
Lovejoy, find her.
1054

1055
1055
1055
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:14,697
1055
- Clear.
1055
- Yes.
1055

1056
1056
1056
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,816
1056
I don't think I've ever seen
1056
such a flat calm.
1056

1057
1057
1057
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:23,175
1057
Like a mill pond.
1057
Not a breath of wind.
1057

1058
1058
1058
01:26:24,464 --> 01:26:27,103
1058
It will make
1058
the 'bergs harder to see ...
1058

1059
1059
1059
01:26:27,384 --> 01:26:29,818
1059
with no breaking water at the base.
1059

1060
1060
1060
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:42,137
1060
Well, I'm off.
1060

1061
1061
1061
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:44,943
1061
Maintain speed and heading,
1061
Mr. Lightoller.
1061

1062
1062
1062
01:26:45,263 --> 01:26:46,458
1062
Yes, sir.
1062

1063
1063
1063
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:58,855
1063
It's getting cold.
1063

1064
1064
1064
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:00,974
1064
- You look nice.
1064
- Miss Rose?
1064

1065
1065
1065
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,342
1065
My drawings.
1065

1066
1066
1066
01:27:28,382 --> 01:27:29,576
1066
Come on, Jack!
1066

1067
1067
1067
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,859
1067
- Wait!
1067
- Wait!
1067

1068
1068
1068
01:27:35,942 --> 01:27:38,058
1068
- Go!
1068
- Take us down, quick.
1068

1069
1069
1069
01:27:38,142 --> 01:27:39,575
1069
- Go!
1069
- Quickly! Quickly!
1069

1070
1070
1070
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:45,776
1070
Bye.
1070

1071
1071
1071
01:27:53,261 --> 01:27:54,250
1071
Sorry.
1071

1072
1072
1072
01:27:59,581 --> 01:28:01,572
1072
- Keep going.
1072
- Thank you, I've got it.
1072

1073
1073
1073
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:13,895
1073
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
1073

1074
1074
1074
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:16,541
1074
- Seems more like a cop.
1074
- I think he was.
1074

1075
1075
1075
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,659
1075
- Oh, shit.
1075
- Go!
1075

1076
1076
1076
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:25,614
1076
- No, over here!
1076
- Quick!
1076

1077
1077
1077
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,695
1077
- Now what?
1077
- What?
1077

1078
1078
1078
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,288
1078
More coal for number one, mate.
1078

1079
1079
1079
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,530
1079
What are you two doing down here?
1079

1080
1080
1080
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,895
1080
You shouldn't be down here.
1080
It could be dangerous!
1080

1081
1081
1081
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:53,774
1081
Carry on. Don't mind us.
1081

1082
1082
1082
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,817
1082
You're doing a great job.
1082
Keep up the good work!
1082

1083
1083
1083
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:14,010
1083
Look at what we have here.
1083

1084
1084
1084
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:32,806
1084
Thank you.
1084

1085
1085
1085
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,457
1085
Where to, miss?
1085

1086
1086
1086
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:48,251
1086
To the stars.
1086

1087
1087
1087
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:07,850
1087
You nervous?
1087

1088
1088
1088
01:30:10,217 --> 01:30:11,252
1088
No.
1088

1089
1089
1089
01:30:27,497 --> 01:30:29,533
1089
Put your hands on me, Jack.
1089

1090
1090
1090
01:30:53,216 --> 01:30:54,729
1090
It's bloody cold.
1090

1091
1091
1091
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:57,488
1091
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
1091
When it's near.
1091

1092
1092
1092
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,969
1092
- Bollocks!
1092
- Well, I can, all right?
1092

1093
1093
1093
01:31:02,895 --> 01:31:05,125
1093
Did you ever find those binoculars
1093
for the lookouts?
1093

1094
1094
1094
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,649
1094
Haven't seen them since Southampton.
1094

1095
1095
1095
01:31:07,735 --> 01:31:10,124
1095
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.
1095

1096
1096
1096
01:31:40,534 --> 01:31:42,126
1096
You're trembling.
1096

1097
1097
1097
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:46,613
1097
Don't worry, I'll be all right.
1097

1098
1098
1098
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:10,008
1098
- They ran down there.
1098
- All right.
1098

1099
1099
1099
01:32:18,813 --> 01:32:20,371
1099
Anything missing?
1099

1100
1100
1100
01:32:44,212 --> 01:32:46,123
1100
I've got a better idea.
1100

1101
1101
1101
01:32:58,412 --> 01:32:59,401
1101
Gotcha!
1101

1102
1102
1102
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:10,447
1102
Did you see those guys' faces?
1102

1103
1103
1103
01:33:11,611 --> 01:33:13,169
1103
Did you see them?
1103

1104
1104
1104
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:21,322
1104
When the ship docks ...
1104

1105
1105
1105
01:33:22,611 --> 01:33:24,567
1105
I'm getting off with you.
1105

1106
1106
1106
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:27,248
1106
- This is crazy.
1106
- I know.
1106

1107
1107
1107
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,242
1107
It doesn't make any sense.
1107

1108
1108
1108
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:32,527
1108
That's why I trust it.
1108

1109
1109
1109
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:43,642
1109
Here, look at this.
1109

1110
1110
1110
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,241
1110
Look at that, would you?
1110

1111
1111
1111
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,321
1111
They're a bit warmer than we are.
1111

1112
1112
1112
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:50,844
1112
If that's what it takes for us
1112
to get warm, I'd rather not ...
1112

1113
1113
1113
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,727
1113
if it's all the same to you, all right?
1113

1114
1114
1114
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,241
1114
Bugger me!
1114

1115
1115
1115
01:34:10,889 --> 01:34:12,686
1115
Pick up, you bastards!
1115

1116
1116
1116
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:18,079
1116
- Is anyone there?
1116
- Yes, what do you see?
1116

1117
1117
1117
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:20,478
1117
- Iceberg, right ahead!
1117
- Thank you.
1117

1118
1118
1118
01:34:23,009 --> 01:34:24,328
1118
Iceberg, right ahead!
1118

1119
1119
1119
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,081
1119
Hard to starboard!
1119

1120
1120
1120
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:35,318
1120
Turn! Smartly!
1120

1121
1121
1121
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:41,282
1121
Full astern!
1121

1122
1122
1122
01:34:43,368 --> 01:34:45,723
1122
- Hard over.
1122
- Helm's hard over, sir.
1122

1123
1123
1123
01:34:49,368 --> 01:34:50,801
1123
Go, lads, go!
1123

1124
1124
1124
01:34:53,448 --> 01:34:55,962
1124
Bring that steam down!
1124
Bring it down!
1124

1125
1125
1125
01:34:57,848 --> 01:35:00,237
1125
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!
1125

1126
1126
1126
01:35:04,808 --> 01:35:06,036
1126
Hold it.
1126

1127
1127
1127
01:35:10,048 --> 01:35:12,322
1127
Now! Engage the reversing engine.
1127

1128
1128
1128
01:35:39,647 --> 01:35:41,443
1128
Why ain't they turning?
1128

1129
1129
1129
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:44,404
1129
- Is it hard over?
1129
- It is. Yes, sir, hard over.
1129

1130
1130
1130
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:52,563
1130
Come on. Come on. Turn.
1130

1131
1131
1131
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:04,035
1131
Yes.
1131

1132
1132
1132
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:10,885
1132
It's gonna hit!
1132

1133
1133
1133
01:36:21,885 --> 01:36:23,284
1133
Jesus Christ!
1133

1134
1134
1134
01:36:43,205 --> 01:36:44,558
1134
Jesus.
1134

1135
1135
1135
01:36:44,645 --> 01:36:47,079
1135
- Hard to port!
1135
- Hard to port!
1135

1136
1136
1136
01:36:56,724 --> 01:36:57,918
1136
Get back!
1136

1137
1137
1137
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:27,356
1137
Come on, let's go!
1137

1138
1138
1138
01:37:27,443 --> 01:37:29,877
1138
Get out of the door.
1138
They're closing the doors!
1138

1139
1139
1139
01:37:29,963 --> 01:37:31,157
1139
Get out!
1139

1140
1140
1140
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:39,238
1140
Get out of the door! Go!
1140

1141
1141
1141
01:37:40,123 --> 01:37:42,842
1141
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!
1141

1142
1142
1142
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:55,797
1142
Out!
1142

1143
1143
1143
01:38:09,882 --> 01:38:11,156
1143
Oh, my God.
1143

1144
1144
1144
01:38:12,482 --> 01:38:14,074
1144
That was a close shave, wasn't it?
1144

1145
1145
1145
01:38:14,162 --> 01:38:16,596
1145
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!
1145

1146
1146
1146
01:38:20,922 --> 01:38:23,436
1146
Note the time and enter it in the log.
1146

1147
1147
1147
01:38:28,961 --> 01:38:30,997
1147
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?
1147

1148
1148
1148
01:38:31,481 --> 01:38:33,039
1148
An iceberg, sir.
1148

1149
1149
1149
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:37,635
1149
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the
1149
engines full astern, but it was too close.
1149

1150
1150
1150
01:38:37,721 --> 01:38:39,916
1150
I tried to port round it, but she hit.
1150

1151
1151
1151
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:43,152
1151
- Close the watertight doors.
1151
- Doors are closed, sir.
1151

1152
1152
1152
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:47,559
1152
- All stop.
1152
- Aye, sir.
1152

1153
1153
1153
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:57,672
1153
Find the carpenter.
1153
Get him to sound the ship.
1153

1154
1154
1154
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,954
1154
Yes, sir.
1154

1155
1155
1155
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,396
1155
Come on, let's get the hell
1155
out of here.
1155

1156
1156
1156
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,515
1156
Come on, hurry up.
1156

1157
1157
1157
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,157
1157
Excuse me,
1157
why have the engines stopped?
1157

1158
1158
1158
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,231
1158
- I felt a shudder.
1158
- I shouldn't worry, madam.
1158

1159
1159
1159
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,232
1159
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.
1159
That's the shudder you felt.
1159

1160
1160
1160
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,117
1160
May I bring you anything?
1160

1161
1161
1161
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:27,268
1161
No, thank you.
1161

1162
1162
1162
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:34,634
1162
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
1162
Did you see anything?
1162

1163
1163
1163
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,516
1163
I don't see anything now. Do you?
1163

1164
1164
1164
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:41,470
1164
If this is the direction the rats
1164
are going, that's good enough for me.
1164

1165
1165
1165
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:46,350
1165
Everything's under control.
1165

1166
1166
1166
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,195
1166
- You there.
1166
- Sir, there is no emergency.
1166

1167
1167
1167
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:51,917
1167
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.
1167

1168
1168
1168
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:53,478
1168
Get the master-at-arms.
1168

1169
1169
1169
01:39:53,559 --> 01:39:55,436
1169
- Now, you moron!
1169
- Yes, sir.
1169

1170
1170
1170
01:39:58,559 --> 01:40:00,435
1170
Hey, did I miss the fun?
1170

1171
1171
1171
01:40:01,918 --> 01:40:03,874
1171
- Did you see what happened?
1171
- No, I missed it.
1171

1172
1172
1172
01:40:03,959 --> 01:40:06,075
1172
Apparently, it hit over there.
1172

1173
1173
1173
01:40:06,278 --> 01:40:08,838
1173
Boiler Room 6 is flooded
1173
8 feet above the plate ...
1173

1174
1174
1174
01:40:08,918 --> 01:40:10,954
1174
and the mail hold is worse.
1174
She's all buckled in —
1174

1175
1175
1175
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,108
1175
- Can you shore up?
1175
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.
1175

1176
1176
1176
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:14,870
1176
Have you seen the damage
1176
in the mail hold?
1176

1177
1177
1177
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:17,074
1177
No, she's already underwater.
1177

1178
1178
1178
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:18,511
1178
This is bad.
1178

1179
1179
1179
01:40:20,718 --> 01:40:22,390
1179
We should tell Mother and Cal.
1179

1180
1180
1180
01:40:23,478 --> 01:40:25,673
1180
I think they're very good, sir.
1180

1181
1181
1181
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,708
1181
Don't touch anything.
1181
I want the entire room photographed.
1181

1182
1182
1182
01:40:36,077 --> 01:40:38,352
1182
We've been looking for you, miss.
1182

1183
1183
1183
01:40:42,477 --> 01:40:43,546
1183
Here we go.
1183

1184
1184
1184
01:40:49,477 --> 01:40:51,672
1184
Something serious has happened.
1184

1185
1185
1185
01:40:52,237 --> 01:40:53,636
1185
Yes, it has.
1185

1186
1186
1186
01:40:54,957 --> 01:40:55,992
1186
Indeed.
1186

1187
1187
1187
01:40:56,077 --> 01:40:58,386
1187
Two things dear to me
1187
have disappeared this evening.
1187

1188
1188
1188
01:40:58,477 --> 01:41:01,593
1188
Now that one is back, I have a pretty
1188
good idea where to find the other.
1188

1189
1189
1189
01:41:01,677 --> 01:41:02,711
1189
Search him.
1189

1190
1190
1190
01:41:02,797 --> 01:41:04,388
1190
- Take your coat off, son.
1190
- Now what?
1190

1191
1191
1191
01:41:04,477 --> 01:41:05,704
1191
Come on, now.
1191

1192
1192
1192
01:41:05,796 --> 01:41:07,594
1192
Cal, what are you doing?
1192

1193
1193
1193
01:41:07,676 --> 01:41:09,906
1193
We're in the middle of an emergency.
1193
What's going on?
1193

1194
1194
1194
01:41:09,996 --> 01:41:12,066
1194
- Is this it?
1194
- That's it.
1194

1195
1195
1195
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:14,268
1195
This is horseshit!
1195

1196
1196
1196
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:16,868
1196
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.
1196

1197
1197
1197
01:41:16,956 --> 01:41:18,867
1197
- He couldn't have.
1197
- Of course he could.
1197

1198
1198
1198
01:41:18,956 --> 01:41:20,548
1198
It's easy enough for a professional.
1198

1199
1199
1199
01:41:20,636 --> 01:41:23,275
1199
But I was with him the whole time.
1199
This is absurd.
1199

1200
1200
1200
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:27,315
1200
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
1200
your clothes back on, dear.
1200

1201
1201
1201
01:41:27,716 --> 01:41:29,866
1201
Real slick, Cal.
1201
Rose, they put it in my pocket.
1201

1202
1202
1202
01:41:29,956 --> 01:41:32,868
1202
- Shut up.
1202
- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?
1202

1203
1203
1203
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:34,947
1203
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."
1203

1204
1204
1204
01:41:38,555 --> 01:41:39,955
1204
That was reported stolen today.
1204

1205
1205
1205
01:41:40,035 --> 01:41:41,866
1205
I just borrowed it.
1205
I was gonna return it.
1205

1206
1206
1206
01:41:41,955 --> 01:41:44,344
1206
An honest thief.
1206
We have an honest thief here, do we?
1206

1207
1207
1207
01:41:44,435 --> 01:41:47,233
1207
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
1207
You know it.
1207

1208
1208
1208
01:41:47,395 --> 01:41:49,033
1208
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.
1208

1209
1209
1209
01:41:49,115 --> 01:41:51,948
1209
- You know I didn't do it.
1209
- Come on, son. Let's go.
1209

1210
1210
1210
01:41:52,035 --> 01:41:54,424
1210
- Rose!
1210
- Come on, there's a good lad.
1210

1211
1211
1211
01:41:54,915 --> 01:41:56,030
1211
Come on.
1211

1212
1212
1212
01:41:56,115 --> 01:41:58,310
1212
You know I didn't do it. You know me!
1212

1213
1213
1213
01:41:59,555 --> 01:42:01,511
1213
This is most unfortunate, Captain.
1213

1214
1214
1214
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:08,466
1214
Water 14 feet above the keel
1214
in 10 minutes ...
1214

1215
1215
1215
01:42:09,154 --> 01:42:12,306
1215
in the forepeak, in all 3 holds,
1215
and in Boiler Room 6.
1215

1216
1216
1216
01:42:12,394 --> 01:42:15,227
1216
- That's right, sir.
1216
- When can we get underway, damn it?
1216

1217
1217
1217
01:42:15,314 --> 01:42:17,270
1217
That's 5 compartments.
1217

1218
1218
1218
01:42:18,914 --> 01:42:21,428
1218
She can stay afloat with the
1218
first 4 compartments breached ...
1218

1219
1219
1219
01:42:21,514 --> 01:42:22,913
1219
but not 5.
1219

1220
1220
1220
01:42:23,354 --> 01:42:24,548
1220
Not 5.
1220

1221
1221
1221
01:42:24,754 --> 01:42:26,267
1221
As she goes down by the head ...
1221

1222
1222
1222
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:29,505
1222
the water will spill over the tops
1222
of the bulkheads at "E" deck ...
1222

1223
1223
1223
01:42:29,834 --> 01:42:32,143
1223
from one to the next, back and back.
1223

1224
1224
1224
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:34,111
1224
There's no stopping it.
1224

1225
1225
1225
01:42:34,194 --> 01:42:35,513
1225
The pumps. We open the pumps ...
1225

1226
1226
1226
01:42:35,594 --> 01:42:38,267
1226
The pumps buy you time,
1226
but minutes only.
1226

1227
1227
1227
01:42:39,313 --> 01:42:41,589
1227
From this moment,
1227
no matter what we do ...
1227

1228
1228
1228
01:42:42,353 --> 01:42:44,071
1228
Titanic will founder.
1228

1229
1229
1229
01:42:46,673 --> 01:42:48,072
1229
But this ship can't sink.
1229

1230
1230
1230
01:42:48,153 --> 01:42:51,941
1230
She's made of iron, sir.
1230
I assure you, she can. And she will.
1230

1231
1231
1231
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,910
1231
It is a mathematical certainty.
1231

1232
1232
1232
01:42:59,393 --> 01:43:00,826
1232
How much time?
1232

1233
1233
1233
01:43:07,992 --> 01:43:10,188
1233
An hour. Two, at most.
1233

1234
1234
1234
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,541
1234
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?
1234

1235
1235
1235
01:43:18,712 --> 01:43:20,942
1235
2,200 souls on board, sir.
1235

1236
1236
1236
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,910
1236
Well, I believe you may
1236
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.
1236

1237
1237
1237
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:50,340
1237
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?
1237

1238
1238
1238
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:53,061
1238
You look at me
1238
when I'm talking to you!
1238

1239
1239
1239
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:55,347
1239
- Mr. Hockley?
1239
- Not now. We're busy.
1239

1240
1240
1240
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:58,150
1240
Sir, I've been told to ask you
1240
to put on your lifebelts ...
1240

1241
1241
1241
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:00,222
1241
and come up to the boat deck.
1241
- I said, not now.
1241

1242
1242
1242
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:03,303
1242
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
1242
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.
1242

1243
1243
1243
01:44:03,391 --> 01:44:05,269
1243
Now please, dress warmly.
1243

1244
1244
1244
01:44:05,552 --> 01:44:07,622
1244
It's quite cold out tonight.
1244

1245
1245
1245
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,506
1245
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?
1245

1246
1246
1246
01:44:10,992 --> 01:44:12,664
1246
This is ridiculous.
1246

1247
1247
1247
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:16,629
1247
Not to worry, miss.
1247
I'm sure it's just a precaution.
1247

1248
1248
1248
01:44:17,073 --> 01:44:18,904
1248
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.
1248

1249
1249
1249
01:44:20,913 --> 01:44:22,631
1249
What's he on about?
1249

1250
1250
1250
01:44:22,713 --> 01:44:24,988
1250
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
1250
- What's the ruckus?
1250

1251
1251
1251
01:44:25,073 --> 01:44:26,348
1251
Just put your lifebelts on.
1251

1252
1252
1252
01:44:27,794 --> 01:44:28,783
1252
CQD?
1252

1253
1253
1253
01:44:29,474 --> 01:44:30,543
1253
Sir?
1253

1254
1254
1254
01:44:32,074 --> 01:44:34,190
1254
That's right, CQD, the distress call.
1254

1255
1255
1255
01:44:34,674 --> 01:44:35,993
1255
That's our position.
1255

1256
1256
1256
01:44:41,195 --> 01:44:43,663
1256
Tell whoever responds that we're
1256
going down by the head ...
1256

1257
1257
1257
01:44:43,755 --> 01:44:45,632
1257
and need immediate assistance.
1257

1258
1258
1258
01:44:54,156 --> 01:44:55,350
1258
Blimey.
1258

1259
1259
1259
01:45:05,357 --> 01:45:06,676
1259
Keep lowering!
1259

1260
1260
1260
01:45:12,678 --> 01:45:16,273
1260
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!
1260

1261
1261
1261
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:24,390
1261
Uncover this boat!
1261
Uncover all the boats aft!
1261

1262
1262
1262
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:26,151
1262
Release those ties!
1262

1263
1263
1263
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:29,112
1263
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!
1263

1264
1264
1264
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:31,278
1264
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?
1264

1265
1265
1265
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,636
1265
They've all gone back inside.
1265
Too damn cold and noisy for them.
1265

1266
1266
1266
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,755
1266
You there!
1266

1267
1267
1267
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:38,631
1267
Get down here
1267
and help with these lines!
1267

1268
1268
1268
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:54,393
1268
Care for a drink, sir?
1268

1269
1269
1269
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:56,756
1269
Please put your lifebelts on.
1269

1270
1270
1270
01:45:56,842 --> 01:45:58,514
1270
Sonny, what's doing?
1270

1271
1271
1271
01:45:58,642 --> 01:46:01,440
1271
You got us all trussed up here
1271
and now we're cooling our heels.
1271

1272
1272
1272
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:03,434
1272
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.
1272

1273
1273
1273
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:07,036
1273
I don't think anybody knows
1273
what the hell's going on around here.
1273

1274
1274
1274
01:46:07,123 --> 01:46:09,876
1274
It's just the goddamned English,
1274
doing everything by the book.
1274

1275
1275
1275
01:46:09,963 --> 01:46:12,682
1275
There's no need
1275
for language, Mr. Hockley.
1275

1276
1276
1276
01:46:12,923 --> 01:46:15,199
1276
Go back and turn the heaters on
1276
in our rooms.
1276

1277
1277
1277
01:46:15,284 --> 01:46:17,081
1277
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.
1277

1278
1278
1278
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:18,961
1278
- Yes, ma'am.
1278
- Yes, ma'am.
1278

1279
1279
1279
01:46:28,165 --> 01:46:29,644
1279
Mr. Andrews ...
1279

1280
1280
1280
01:46:31,085 --> 01:46:33,997
1280
I saw the iceberg.
1280
And I see it in your eyes.
1280

1281
1281
1281
01:46:34,365 --> 01:46:35,765
1281
Please tell me the truth.
1281

1282
1282
1282
01:46:44,006 --> 01:46:45,679
1282
The ship will sink.
1282

1283
1283
1283
01:46:47,327 --> 01:46:48,919
1283
- You're certain?
1283
- Yes.
1283

1284
1284
1284
01:46:49,207 --> 01:46:50,879
1284
In an hour or so ...
1284

1285
1285
1285
01:46:51,647 --> 01:46:54,719
1285
all this will be
1285
at the bottom of the Atlantic.
1285

1286
1286
1286
01:46:55,407 --> 01:46:56,443
1286
What?
1286

1287
1287
1287
01:46:56,528 --> 01:46:58,484
1287
Please, tell only who you must.
1287

1288
1288
1288
01:46:58,568 --> 01:47:00,718
1288
I don't want to be
1288
responsible for a panic.
1288

1289
1289
1289
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:03,448
1289
And get to a boat.
1289
Quickly. Don't wait.
1289

1290
1290
1290
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:07,322
1290
You remember
1290
what I told you about the boats?
1290

1291
1291
1291
01:47:09,649 --> 01:47:10,684
1291
Yes.
1291

1292
1292
1292
01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:14,002
1292
I understand.
1292

1293
1293
1293
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:20,479
1293
Yes, madam,
1293
please put it on immediately.
1293

1294
1294
1294
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:23,169
1294
Over here, son.
1294

1295
1295
1295
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:26,399
1295
Sir, they need you up
1295
at the second-class purser's office.
1295

1296
1296
1296
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:29,369
1296
- There's a big mob up there.
1296
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.
1296

1297
1297
1297
01:47:29,891 --> 01:47:31,244
1297
Aye. Right.
1297

1298
1298
1298
01:47:44,612 --> 01:47:45,681
1298
Sir!
1298

1299
1299
1299
01:47:45,772 --> 01:47:48,127
1299
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
1299

1300
1300
1300
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,089
1300
Full steam for them, sir.
1300

1301
1301
1301
01:47:51,373 --> 01:47:52,931
1301
She's the only one who's responding?
1301

1302
1302
1302
01:47:53,013 --> 01:47:54,412
1302
The only one close, sir.
1302

1303
1303
1303
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:56,609
1303
Says they can be here in 4 hours.
1303

1304
1304
1304
01:47:57,133 --> 01:47:58,452
1304
4 hours!
1304

1305
1305
1305
01:48:03,574 --> 01:48:05,132
1305
Thank you, Bride.
1305

1306
1306
1306
01:48:09,454 --> 01:48:10,603
1306
My God.
1306

1307
1307
1307
01:48:19,855 --> 01:48:22,085
1307
We are swung out and ready, sir.
1307

1308
1308
1308
01:48:23,216 --> 01:48:26,413
1308
Hadn't we better get the women
1308
and children into the boats, sir?
1308

1309
1309
1309
01:48:28,896 --> 01:48:30,011
1309
Yes.
1309

1310
1310
1310
01:48:30,096 --> 01:48:31,131
1310
Sir?
1310

1311
1311
1311
01:48:33,697 --> 01:48:36,894
1311
Women and children first, yes.
1311

1312
1312
1312
01:48:38,257 --> 01:48:39,485
1312
Yes, sir.
1312

1313
1313
1313
01:48:42,297 --> 01:48:45,335
1313
Ladies and gentlemen,
1313
your attention, please!
1313

1314
1314
1314
01:48:45,658 --> 01:48:47,888
1314
Step this way, please. That's right.
1314

1315
1315
1315
01:48:48,058 --> 01:48:50,367
1315
Come towards me. Thank you.
1315

1316
1316
1316
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:52,887
1316
Good.
1316

1317
1317
1317
01:48:53,058 --> 01:48:56,938
1317
For the time being, I shall
1317
require only women and children.
1317

1318
1318
1318
01:48:57,219 --> 01:48:59,255
1318
- Gentlemen, please.
1318
- Right here.
1318

1319
1319
1319
01:48:59,339 --> 01:49:02,968
1319
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
1319
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.
1319

1320
1320
1320
01:49:04,019 --> 01:49:05,578
1320
Wedding Dance.
1320

1321
1321
1321
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,655
1321
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.
1321

1322
1322
1322
01:49:17,181 --> 01:49:18,819
1322
Here, put your lifebelt on.
1322

1323
1323
1323
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:20,937
1323
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.
1323

1324
1324
1324
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:22,579
1324
Turn that around.
1324

1325
1325
1325
01:49:23,621 --> 01:49:24,815
1325
Please.
1325

1326
1326
1326
01:49:26,781 --> 01:49:29,171
1326
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!
1326

1327
1327
1327
01:49:29,542 --> 01:49:31,021
1327
Please stay calm.
1327

1328
1328
1328
01:49:31,102 --> 01:49:34,777
1328
Make sure, everybody,
1328
you've got your lifebelts on.
1328

1329
1329
1329
01:49:34,862 --> 01:49:37,535
1329
And, gentlemen, allow the women
1329
and children through to the front.
1329

1330
1330
1330
01:49:37,622 --> 01:49:39,932
1330
- What are we doing, Mommy?
1330
- We're just waiting, dear.
1330

1331
1331
1331
01:49:40,023 --> 01:49:42,412
1331
When they finish putting
1331
first-class people in the boats ...
1331

1332
1332
1332
01:49:42,503 --> 01:49:45,540
1332
they will be starting with us
1332
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?
1332

1333
1333
1333
01:49:45,623 --> 01:49:47,056
1333
Everybody, not just right yet.
1333

1334
1334
1334
01:49:47,143 --> 01:49:48,975
1334
Don't push on the gates.
1334
You won't get out any faster.
1334

1335
1335
1335
01:49:49,064 --> 01:49:50,417
1335
- Someone help.
1335
- Go and get some help.
1335

1336
1336
1336
01:49:50,504 --> 01:49:52,972
1336
Lower it away, left and right together!
1336

1337
1337
1337
01:49:55,144 --> 01:49:57,419
1337
Both sides together! Steady!
1337

1338
1338
1338
01:49:58,224 --> 01:49:59,419
1338
Steady!
1338

1339
1339
1339
01:50:02,465 --> 01:50:03,944
1339
Stop!
1339

1340
1340
1340
01:50:04,945 --> 01:50:06,617
1340
Hold the left side!
1340

1341
1341
1341
01:50:06,705 --> 01:50:08,900
1341
Right side only!
1341

1342
1342
1342
01:50:09,225 --> 01:50:11,535
1342
Right side only. Hold the left side!
1342

1343
1343
1343
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:14,624
1343
Lower away together!
1343

1344
1344
1344
01:50:16,346 --> 01:50:17,779
1344
Steady, lads!
1344

1345
1345
1345
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:06,469
1345
You know,
1345
I do believe this ship may sink.
1345

1346
1346
1346
01:51:08,951 --> 01:51:12,739
1346
I've been asked to give you
1346
this small token of our appreciation.
1346

1347
1347
1347
01:51:15,632 --> 01:51:18,021
1347
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.
1347

1348
1348
1348
01:51:24,712 --> 01:51:27,466
1348
Come on, sister. You heard the man.
1348
Into the boat.
1348

1349
1349
1349
01:51:27,833 --> 01:51:29,630
1349
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?
1349

1350
1350
1350
01:51:29,713 --> 01:51:31,783
1350
Only women at this time, sir.
1350

1351
1351
1351
01:51:34,153 --> 01:51:36,952
1351
Will the lifeboats be seated
1351
according to class?
1351

1352
1352
1352
01:51:38,354 --> 01:51:40,584
1352
I hope they're not too crowded.
1352

1353
1353
1353
01:51:41,674 --> 01:51:43,904
1353
Oh, Mother, shut up!
1353

1354
1354
1354
01:51:44,394 --> 01:51:45,873
1354
Don't you understand?
1354

1355
1355
1355
01:51:45,954 --> 01:51:48,230
1355
The water is freezing
1355
and there aren't enough boats.
1355

1356
1356
1356
01:51:48,315 --> 01:51:49,953
1356
Not enough by half.
1356

1357
1357
1357
01:51:50,315 --> 01:51:52,545
1357
Half the people on this ship
1357
are going to die.
1357

1358
1358
1358
01:51:52,835 --> 01:51:54,553
1358
Not the better half.
1358

1359
1359
1359
01:51:56,235 --> 01:52:00,070
1359
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
1359
First-class seats are right up here.
1359

1360
1360
1360
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:02,792
1360
You know, it's a pity
1360
I didn't keep that drawing.
1360

1361
1361
1361
01:52:02,876 --> 01:52:04,753
1361
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.
1361

1362
1362
1362
01:52:04,836 --> 01:52:07,794
1362
Women and children
1362
towards the front, please.
1362

1363
1363
1363
01:52:07,876 --> 01:52:10,266
1363
You unimaginable bastard.
1363

1364
1364
1364
01:52:11,197 --> 01:52:13,836
1364
Come on, Rose, darling.
1364
There's plenty of room for you.
1364

1365
1365
1365
01:52:13,917 --> 01:52:15,032
1365
Right this way, miss.
1365

1366
1366
1366
01:52:15,117 --> 01:52:16,516
1366
Come on, Rose.
1366

1367
1367
1367
01:52:16,597 --> 01:52:18,315
1367
You're next, darling.
1367

1368
1368
1368
01:52:18,477 --> 01:52:20,389
1368
Come into the boat, Rose.
1368

1369
1369
1369
01:52:21,518 --> 01:52:22,587
1369
Come.
1369

1370
1370
1370
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:24,107
1370
Rose?
1370

1371
1371
1371
01:52:25,158 --> 01:52:26,796
1371
Get into the boat.
1371

1372
1372
1372
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:28,187
1372
Rose?
1372

1373
1373
1373
01:52:29,638 --> 01:52:31,197
1373
Goodbye, Mother.
1373

1374
1374
1374
01:52:32,799 --> 01:52:33,868
1374
Rose?
1374

1375
1375
1375
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:36,708
1375
- Rose, come back here.
1375
- Where are you going?
1375

1376
1376
1376
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,348
1376
To him?
1376

1377
1377
1377
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:40,390
1377
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?
1377

1378
1378
1378
01:52:40,479 --> 01:52:41,469
1378
No, wait.
1378

1379
1379
1379
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,199
1379
I'd rather be his whore
1379
than your wife.
1379

1380
1380
1380
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,189
1380
No!
1380

1381
1381
1381
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,113
1381
I said, no!
1381

1382
1382
1382
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:53,712
1382
Rose, please stop!
1382

1383
1383
1383
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:56,959
1383
- Lower away!
1383
- No, stop!
1383

1384
1384
1384
01:52:57,041 --> 01:52:58,679
1384
- All together.
1384
- No, wait!
1384

1385
1385
1385
01:52:58,761 --> 01:53:00,080
1385
Lower away!
1385

1386
1386
1386
01:53:00,241 --> 01:53:01,356
1386
Rose!
1386

1387
1387
1387
01:53:07,522 --> 01:53:08,591
1387
Help!
1387

1388
1388
1388
01:53:09,322 --> 01:53:11,313
1388
Can anybody hear me?
1388

1389
1389
1389
01:53:12,442 --> 01:53:14,320
1389
Hello! Help me!
1389

1390
1390
1390
01:53:24,124 --> 01:53:25,443
1390
Mr. Andrews!
1390

1391
1391
1391
01:53:28,724 --> 01:53:31,284
1391
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
1391
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.
1391

1392
1392
1392
01:53:31,364 --> 01:53:34,162
1392
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.
1392
Get to the boat deck immediately.
1392

1393
1393
1393
01:53:34,244 --> 01:53:36,805
1393
Lucy, for God's sake, put on
1393
a lifebelt and set a good example.
1393

1394
1394
1394
01:53:36,885 --> 01:53:38,113
1394
Yes, sir.
1394

1395
1395
1395
01:53:38,565 --> 01:53:40,760
1395
- Anyone in here?
1395
- Mr. Andrews?
1395

1396
1396
1396
01:53:41,045 --> 01:53:42,080
1396
Thank God.
1396

1397
1397
1397
01:53:42,165 --> 01:53:44,725
1397
Where would the master-at-arms
1397
take someone under arrest?
1397

1398
1398
1398
01:53:45,045 --> 01:53:47,480
1398
- You have to get to a boat right away.
1398
- No!
1398

1399
1399
1399
01:53:47,566 --> 01:53:49,796
1399
I'm doing this with or
1399
without your help, sir.
1399

1400
1400
1400
01:53:49,886 --> 01:53:51,842
1400
But without will take longer.
1400

1401
1401
1401
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:55,924
1401
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
1401
Go to the left.
1401

1402
1402
1402
01:53:56,007 --> 01:53:59,556
1402
Down the crewmen's passage, then
1402
go right and left again at the stairs.
1402

1403
1403
1403
01:53:59,647 --> 01:54:01,080
1403
You'll come to a long corridor.
1403

1404
1404
1404
01:54:05,167 --> 01:54:06,806
1404
This could be bad.
1404

1405
1405
1405
01:54:10,928 --> 01:54:12,122
1405
Oh, shit!
1405

1406
1406
1406
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:20,481
1406
Excuse me. Thank you.
1406

1407
1407
1407
01:54:21,849 --> 01:54:24,079
1407
- I do not care what you think, sir.
1407
- Lifts are closed.
1407

1408
1408
1408
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:26,922
1408
I'm sorry, miss,
1408
but the lifts are closed.
1408

1409
1409
1409
01:54:27,889 --> 01:54:31,360
1409
I'm through being polite,
1409
God damn it! Now, take me down!
1409

1410
1410
1410
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:34,165
1410
"E" deck.
1410

1411
1411
1411
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:38,804
1411
Come on.
1411

1412
1412
1412
01:54:57,612 --> 01:54:59,250
1412
- I'm going back up.
1412
- No.
1412

1413
1413
1413
01:55:04,733 --> 01:55:08,043
1413
Come back! I'm going back up!
1413

1414
1414
1414
01:55:16,374 --> 01:55:17,807
1414
Crew passage.
1414

1415
1415
1415
01:55:39,936 --> 01:55:41,051
1415
Jack!
1415

1416
1416
1416
01:55:53,377 --> 01:55:54,413
1416
Rose!
1416

1417
1417
1417
01:55:55,418 --> 01:55:56,407
1417
Jack!
1417

1418
1418
1418
01:55:56,498 --> 01:55:58,090
1418
Rose, I'm in here!
1418

1419
1419
1419
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:00,407
1419
Jack!
1419

1420
1420
1420
01:56:01,418 --> 01:56:02,453
1420
- Jack!
1420
- Rose!
1420

1421
1421
1421
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:05,099
1421
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.
1421

1422
1422
1422
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:07,729
1422
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
1422

1423
1423
1423
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:12,254
1423
- That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.
1423
- I know. I know.
1423

1424
1424
1424
01:56:12,339 --> 01:56:13,488
1424
Listen, Rose ...
1424

1425
1425
1425
01:56:13,579 --> 01:56:15,615
1425
you're gonna have to find
1425
a spare key, all right?
1425

1426
1426
1426
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:17,691
1426
Look in that cabinet right there.
1426

1427
1427
1427
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:20,250
1427
It's a little silver one, Rose.
1427

1428
1428
1428
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,129
1428
Silver.
1428

1429
1429
1429
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:24,696
1429
These are all brass ones!
1429

1430
1430
1430
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:26,772
1430
Check right here, Rose.
1430

1431
1431
1431
01:56:30,701 --> 01:56:31,895
1431
Rose ...
1431

1432
1432
1432
01:56:33,061 --> 01:56:35,131
1432
how'd you find out I didn't do it?
1432

1433
1433
1433
01:56:35,301 --> 01:56:38,021
1433
I didn't.
1433
I just realized I already knew.
1433

1434
1434
1434
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:41,975
1434
Keep looking.
1434

1435
1435
1435
01:56:50,463 --> 01:56:52,897
1435
No key. There's no key!
1435

1436
1436
1436
01:56:52,983 --> 01:56:54,018
1436
All right, Rose, listen.
1436

1437
1437
1437
01:56:54,103 --> 01:56:56,094
1437
You're gonna have to go
1437
find some help.
1437

1438
1438
1438
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,096
1438
It'll be all right.
1438

1439
1439
1439
01:57:02,264 --> 01:57:03,936
1439
I'll be right back.
1439

1440
1440
1440
01:57:11,105 --> 01:57:12,823
1440
I'll just wait here!
1440

1441
1441
1441
01:57:25,306 --> 01:57:27,376
1441
Hello? Is there anyone here?
1441

1442
1442
1442
01:57:27,786 --> 01:57:28,901
1442
Hello?
1442

1443
1443
1443
01:57:29,706 --> 01:57:31,777
1443
Is there anybody down here?
1443

1444
1444
1444
01:57:32,427 --> 01:57:34,145
1444
We need help! Hello?
1444

1445
1445
1445
01:57:35,907 --> 01:57:37,101
1445
Damn it.
1445

1446
1446
1446
01:57:42,828 --> 01:57:45,262
1446
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?
1446

1447
1447
1447
01:57:48,508 --> 01:57:49,736
1447
Oh, thank God.
1447

1448
1448
1448
01:57:49,868 --> 01:57:52,986
1448
Wait, I need your help.
1448
There's a man back here.
1448

1449
1449
1449
01:57:53,309 --> 01:57:54,298
1449
Wait!
1449

1450
1450
1450
01:57:58,309 --> 01:57:59,458
1450
Hello?
1450

1451
1451
1451
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:25,541
1451
Hello?
1451

1452
1452
1452
01:58:26,352 --> 01:58:27,785
1452
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.
1452

1453
1453
1453
01:58:27,872 --> 01:58:30,306
1453
- I need your help.
1453
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.
1453

1454
1454
1454
01:58:30,392 --> 01:58:31,791
1454
There's a man down here. He's trapped.
1454

1455
1455
1455
01:58:31,872 --> 01:58:34,147
1455
- This way. There is no need to panic.
1455
- Please!
1455

1456
1456
1456
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:36,906
1456
No, I'm not panicking!
1456
You're going the wrong way!
1456

1457
1457
1457
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:38,911
1457
Let go of me! Listen!
1457

1458
1458
1458
01:58:44,033 --> 01:58:45,625
1458
The hell with you.
1458

1459
1459
1459
01:59:21,557 --> 01:59:22,910
1459
Oh, my God.
1459

1460
1460
1460
02:00:09,361 --> 02:00:10,430
1460
Jack!
1460

1461
1461
1461
02:00:10,921 --> 02:00:11,990
1461
Rose!
1461

1462
1462
1462
02:00:13,082 --> 02:00:14,561
1462
Will this work?
1462

1463
1463
1463
02:00:15,482 --> 02:00:17,712
1463
I guess we'll find out. Come on.
1463

1464
1464
1464
02:00:21,082 --> 02:00:22,151
1464
Wait.
1464

1465
1465
1465
02:00:22,442 --> 02:00:24,399
1465
Try a couple
1465
of practice swings over there.
1465

1466
1466
1466
02:00:30,123 --> 02:00:33,832
1466
Good. Now try to hit the same
1466
mark again, Rose. You can do it.
1466

1467
1467
1467
02:00:39,444 --> 02:00:41,196
1467
Okay. That's enough practice.
1467

1468
1468
1468
02:00:41,524 --> 02:00:43,116
1468
Come on, Rose. You can do it.
1468

1469
1469
1469
02:00:43,924 --> 02:00:46,962
1469
Listen, just hit it really hard
1469
and really fast.
1469

1470
1470
1470
02:00:48,885 --> 02:00:50,238
1470
Come on. Wait.
1470

1471
1471
1471
02:00:50,365 --> 02:00:51,957
1471
Open your hands up a little more.
1471

1472
1472
1472
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:53,114
1472
- Good.
1472
- Like that?
1472

1473
1473
1473
02:00:53,205 --> 02:00:54,354
1473
Right.
1473

1474
1474
1474
02:00:54,605 --> 02:00:56,562
1474
Listen, Rose, I trust you.
1474

1475
1475
1475
02:01:01,366 --> 02:01:02,355
1475
Go.
1475

1476
1476
1476
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:09,316
1476
You did it!
1476

1477
1477
1477
02:01:09,687 --> 02:01:11,245
1477
Come on, let's go.
1477

1478
1478
1478
02:01:11,367 --> 02:01:13,198
1478
Oh, shit, this is cold!
1478

1479
1479
1479
02:01:21,088 --> 02:01:22,806
1479
This is the way out.
1479

1480
1480
1480
02:01:23,008 --> 02:01:25,476
1480
We have to find another way.
1480
Come on.
1480

1481
1481
1481
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,484
1481
Now there's something
1481
you don't see every day.
1481

1482
1482
1482
02:02:02,771 --> 02:02:06,047
1482
What's this luggage doing here?
1482
Get rid of it. We need the room.
1482

1483
1483
1483
02:02:06,131 --> 02:02:07,689
1483
Get rid of that! Out!
1483

1484
1484
1484
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:11,129
1484
Come. Time for her to go, sir.
1484
Step back.
1484

1485
1485
1485
02:02:11,212 --> 02:02:13,362
1485
- Keep calm. Sit down.
1485
- No.
1485

1486
1486
1486
02:02:13,652 --> 02:02:16,007
1486
- No!
1486
- Make more room.
1486

1487
1487
1487
02:02:17,052 --> 02:02:18,724
1487
That's right. Look sharp.
1487

1488
1488
1488
02:02:19,612 --> 02:02:20,761
1488
Lovejoy.
1488

1489
1489
1489
02:02:20,852 --> 02:02:22,969
1489
She's not on the starboard side, either.
1489

1490
1490
1490
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:24,402
1490
We're running out of time.
1490

1491
1491
1491
02:02:24,493 --> 02:02:27,530
1491
This strutting martinet
1491
isn't letting any men on at all.
1491

1492
1492
1492
02:02:27,773 --> 02:02:30,241
1492
There's one on the other side
1492
letting men on.
1492

1493
1493
1493
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:31,766
1493
Then that's our play.
1493

1494
1494
1494
02:02:32,013 --> 02:02:34,653
1494
We'll need some insurance first.
1494
Come on.
1494

1495
1495
1495
02:02:34,734 --> 02:02:37,407
1495
Come on, this way, please.
1495
All the way down there.
1495

1496
1496
1496
02:02:39,854 --> 02:02:40,923
1496
Here!
1496

1497
1497
1497
02:02:41,694 --> 02:02:43,890
1497
What do you think you're doing?
1497

1498
1498
1498
02:02:43,975 --> 02:02:46,045
1498
You'll have to pay for that, you know.
1498

1499
1499
1499
02:02:46,175 --> 02:02:48,894
1499
- That's White Star Line property.
1499
- Shut up!
1499

1500
1500
1500
02:02:50,535 --> 02:02:54,006
1500
Will you hold the boat a moment?
1500
I just have to run back to my room ...
1500

1501
1501
1501
02:02:54,096 --> 02:02:57,054
1501
- Sit down.
1501
- She's the last.
1501

1502
1502
1502
02:02:57,136 --> 02:03:00,890
1502
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats
1502
being launched half-full?
1502

1503
1503
1503
02:03:00,976 --> 02:03:02,648
1503
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
1503
- There, look.
1503

1504
1504
1504
02:03:02,776 --> 02:03:05,291
1504
20 or so in a boat built for 65?
1504

1505
1505
1505
02:03:05,377 --> 02:03:07,732
1505
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!
1505

1506
1506
1506
02:03:07,817 --> 02:03:10,536
1506
We weren't sure of the weight,
1506
Mr. Andrews.
1506

1507
1507
1507
02:03:10,617 --> 02:03:12,847
1507
- These boats may buckle.
1507
- Rubbish!
1507

1508
1508
1508
02:03:13,057 --> 02:03:15,618
1508
They were tested in Belfast
1508
with the weight of 70 men.
1508

1509
1509
1509
02:03:15,698 --> 02:03:18,656
1509
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
1509
For God's sake, man!
1509

1510
1510
1510
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:28,297
1510
Please, I need more
1510
women and children!
1510

1511
1511
1511
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:35,294
1511
Get back in there!
1511
This is not an exit.
1511

1512
1512
1512
02:03:35,379 --> 02:03:36,938
1512
Get back in there.
1512

1513
1513
1513
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:43,135
1513
You can't keep us locked in here
1513
like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.
1513

1514
1514
1514
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,256
1514
Bring forward the women.
1514

1515
1515
1515
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,296
1515
Unlock the gates.
1515

1516
1516
1516
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,299
1516
Women only!
1516

1517
1517
1517
02:04:02,222 --> 02:04:03,735
1517
Lock the gates!
1517

1518
1518
1518
02:04:11,823 --> 02:04:14,860
1518
For God's sake, man, there are
1518
women and children down here!
1518

1519
1519
1519
02:04:14,983 --> 02:04:17,577
1519
Let us up, so we can have a chance!
1519

1520
1520
1520
02:04:17,863 --> 02:04:19,091
1520
Get back!
1520

1521
1521
1521
02:04:22,424 --> 02:04:23,698
1521
- Jack.
1521
- Tommy.
1521

1522
1522
1522
02:04:23,784 --> 02:04:25,581
1522
- Can we get out?
1522
- It's hopeless that way.
1522

1523
1523
1523
02:04:25,664 --> 02:04:27,700
1523
Whatever we do,
1523
we've got to do it fast.
1523

1524
1524
1524
02:04:27,824 --> 02:04:29,018
1524
Jack!
1524

1525
1525
1525
02:04:29,104 --> 02:04:30,332
1525
Fabrizio.
1525

1526
1526
1526
02:04:30,785 --> 02:04:32,059
1526
The boats are all gone.
1526

1527
1527
1527
02:04:32,145 --> 02:04:34,101
1527
This whole place is flooding.
1527
We've got to get out.
1527

1528
1528
1528
02:04:34,185 --> 02:04:36,062
1528
- There is niente this way.
1528
- All right.
1528

1529
1529
1529
02:04:36,185 --> 02:04:37,857
1529
Let's go this way,
1529
all right? Come on.
1529

1530
1530
1530
02:04:43,426 --> 02:04:45,701
1530
- I make my own luck.
1530
- So do I.
1530

1531
1531
1531
02:04:53,547 --> 02:04:54,741
1531
Come on!
1531

1532
1532
1532
02:04:55,387 --> 02:04:56,900
1532
No, come on, let's go this way.
1532

1533
1533
1533
02:05:05,828 --> 02:05:07,102
1533
This way.
1533

1534
1534
1534
02:05:07,188 --> 02:05:11,306
1534
Just go back to the main stairwell
1534
and everything will be sorted out there.
1534

1535
1535
1535
02:05:11,388 --> 02:05:12,377
1535
The hell it will.
1535

1536
1536
1536
02:05:12,708 --> 02:05:15,985
1536
It will all get sorted out back there.
1536
Go back to the main stairwell.
1536

1537
1537
1537
02:05:16,109 --> 02:05:18,100
1537
- Open the gate.
1537
- Go back down the main stairwell.
1537

1538
1538
1538
02:05:18,189 --> 02:05:19,178
1538
Open the gate right now.
1538

1539
1539
1539
02:05:19,269 --> 02:05:21,624
1539
Go back down the main stairwell
1539
like I told you!
1539

1540
1540
1540
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:26,344
1540
God damn it! Son of a bitch!
1540

1541
1541
1541
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:27,784
1541
Stop that!
1541

1542
1542
1542
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:29,702
1542
Open the damn gate!
1542

1543
1543
1543
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:33,464
1543
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.
1543

1544
1544
1544
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:35,701
1544
- Move aside. Move aside!
1544
- Pull!
1544

1545
1545
1545
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:37,860
1545
Pull!
1545

1546
1546
1546
02:05:38,591 --> 02:05:40,741
1546
- Move aside.
1546
- Put that down!
1546

1547
1547
1547
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:42,469
1547
- Move aside!
1547
- Put that down!
1547

1548
1548
1548
02:05:42,551 --> 02:05:44,587
1548
- One! Two!
1548
- Stop that!
1548

1549
1549
1549
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:45,780
1549
Three!
1549

1550
1550
1550
02:05:47,912 --> 02:05:48,901
1550
Again!
1550

1551
1551
1551
02:05:51,032 --> 02:05:52,260
1551
Let's go!
1551

1552
1552
1552
02:05:54,192 --> 02:05:55,227
1552
Let's go, Rose.
1552

1553
1553
1553
02:05:55,312 --> 02:05:57,508
1553
You can't go up there!
1553
You can't do this!
1553

1554
1554
1554
02:06:03,913 --> 02:06:05,585
1554
Keep order here!
1554

1555
1555
1555
02:06:05,673 --> 02:06:07,790
1555
Get back. Get back!
1555

1556
1556
1556
02:06:12,674 --> 02:06:14,153
1556
Hold on to her!
1556

1557
1557
1557
02:06:15,114 --> 02:06:16,263
1557
Pull her in.
1557

1558
1558
1558
02:06:16,914 --> 02:06:18,985
1558
Get back, I say ...
1558

1559
1559
1559
02:06:19,195 --> 02:06:21,663
1559
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!
1559

1560
1560
1560
02:06:21,755 --> 02:06:22,983
1560
Keep order here!
1560

1561
1561
1561
02:06:24,555 --> 02:06:26,068
1561
Keep order, I say.
1561

1562
1562
1562
02:06:27,635 --> 02:06:29,513
1562
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.
1562

1563
1563
1563
02:06:33,756 --> 02:06:34,825
1563
Right.
1563

1564
1564
1564
02:06:34,916 --> 02:06:37,669
1564
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.
1564

1565
1565
1565
02:06:43,757 --> 02:06:44,985
1565
Stay back!
1565

1566
1566
1566
02:06:45,677 --> 02:06:46,826
1566
We're too late.
1566

1567
1567
1567
02:06:46,917 --> 02:06:48,794
1567
There are more boats down the front.
1567

1568
1568
1568
02:06:48,877 --> 02:06:51,915
1568
Stay with this one. Murdoch.
1568
He seems to be quite practical.
1568

1569
1569
1569
02:06:53,838 --> 02:06:55,317
1569
Stop lowering!
1569

1570
1570
1570
02:06:56,438 --> 02:06:57,666
1570
Stop lowering!
1570

1571
1571
1571
02:06:57,998 --> 02:06:59,317
1571
Cut the falls!
1571

1572
1572
1572
02:07:05,999 --> 02:07:07,318
1572
Sit down!
1572

1573
1573
1573
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:10,748
1573
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!
1573

1574
1574
1574
02:07:10,959 --> 02:07:13,394
1574
Stay back, the lot of you!
1574
Just stay back!
1574

1575
1575
1575
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,480
1575
It's starting to fall apart.
1575
We don't have much time.
1575

1576
1576
1576
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,114
1576
Mr. Murdoch?
1576

1577
1577
1577
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:23,914
1577
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!
1577

1578
1578
1578
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:27,438
1578
I'm a businessman, as you know,
1578
I have a business proposition for you.
1578

1579
1579
1579
02:07:34,842 --> 02:07:35,991
1579
Come on, Rose.
1579

1580
1580
1580
02:07:39,282 --> 02:07:41,034
1580
The boats are gone!
1580

1581
1581
1581
02:07:45,683 --> 02:07:47,275
1581
Colonel, are there any boats
1581
on that side?
1581

1582
1582
1582
02:07:47,363 --> 02:07:49,752
1582
No, miss, but there are a couple
1582
of boats all the way forward.
1582

1583
1583
1583
02:07:49,843 --> 02:07:51,401
1583
This way, I'll lead you.
1583

1584
1584
1584
02:07:57,404 --> 02:08:00,077
1584
What's the use?
1584
Nobody's listening to us anyway.
1584

1585
1585
1585
02:08:00,604 --> 02:08:04,392
1585
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.
1585
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.
1585

1586
1586
1586
02:08:05,764 --> 02:08:06,880
1586
Orpheus.
1586

1587
1587
1587
02:08:11,645 --> 02:08:14,478
1587
Music to drown by.
1587
Now I know I'm in first class.
1587

1588
1588
1588
02:08:19,526 --> 02:08:22,484
1588
- Where is everyone?
1588
- They're all still aft, sir.
1588

1589
1589
1589
02:08:22,686 --> 02:08:24,165
1589
Come on, madam, don't cry.
1589

1590
1590
1590
02:08:24,886 --> 02:08:27,081
1590
We have an understanding,
1590
then, Mr. Murdoch.
1590

1591
1591
1591
02:08:37,767 --> 02:08:41,556
1591
Will the men please hold back?
1591
Hold back, I say!
1591

1592
1592
1592
02:08:44,128 --> 02:08:47,677
1592
Women and children only! Get back!
1592

1593
1593
1593
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,199
1593
I said, step back, sir.
1593
Come through, madam.
1593

1594
1594
1594
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:52,086
1594
This way. Step back, sir!
1594

1595
1595
1595
02:08:52,169 --> 02:08:53,158
1595
Let the women —
1595

1596
1596
1596
02:08:53,249 --> 02:08:55,285
1596
You better check the other side. Go!
1596

1597
1597
1597
02:09:02,810 --> 02:09:06,325
1597
I found her, on the other side.
1597
Waiting for a boat ...
1597

1598
1598
1598
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:08,119
1598
with him.
1598

1599
1599
1599
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:11,930
1599
- Any more women and children?
1599
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.
1599

1600
1600
1600
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:13,524
1600
Anyone else then?
1600

1601
1601
1601
02:09:14,491 --> 02:09:15,844
1601
- Hop on, sir.
1601
- Anyone else?
1601

1602
1602
1602
02:09:15,931 --> 02:09:17,762
1602
Do hurry. Hurry along.
1602

1603
1603
1603
02:09:20,971 --> 02:09:22,325
1603
Stand by the falls.
1603

1604
1604
1604
02:09:22,412 --> 02:09:24,209
1604
God damn it all to hell.
1604

1605
1605
1605
02:09:26,692 --> 02:09:27,727
1605
Shit.
1605

1606
1606
1606
02:09:27,812 --> 02:09:28,801
1606
Fire!
1606

1607
1607
1607
02:09:29,932 --> 02:09:32,128
1607
Sir, you can't go through here.
1607

1608
1608
1608
02:09:32,493 --> 02:09:34,290
1608
Sir, you can't go through.
1608

1609
1609
1609
02:09:36,053 --> 02:09:38,009
1609
That's it. Splendid. Right.
1609

1610
1610
1610
02:09:42,213 --> 02:09:43,567
1610
Prepare to lower!
1610

1611
1611
1611
02:09:45,814 --> 02:09:47,406
1611
Ready on the left!
1611

1612
1612
1612
02:09:53,254 --> 02:09:54,574
1612
Take them down.
1612

1613
1613
1613
02:09:59,415 --> 02:10:00,689
1613
Keep it steady.
1613

1614
1614
1614
02:10:03,135 --> 02:10:06,446
1614
Both sides together.
1614
Steady. Keep it steady.
1614

1615
1615
1615
02:10:07,976 --> 02:10:10,046
1615
- Give her to me.
1615
- Daddy.
1615

1616
1616
1616
02:10:10,336 --> 02:10:12,896
1616
- It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.
1616
- Take her.
1616

1617
1617
1617
02:10:12,976 --> 02:10:14,694
1617
Daddy, get in the boat.
1617

1618
1618
1618
02:10:14,776 --> 02:10:18,087
1618
It's goodbye for a little while.
1618
Only for a little while.
1618

1619
1619
1619
02:10:18,177 --> 02:10:19,815
1619
There'll be another
1619
boat for the daddies ...
1619

1620
1620
1620
02:10:19,897 --> 02:10:21,569
1620
this boat's for the mommies
1620
and the children.
1620

1621
1621
1621
02:10:21,657 --> 02:10:24,410
1621
You hold Mommy's hand
1621
and be a good little girl.
1621

1622
1622
1622
02:10:25,097 --> 02:10:26,292
1622
I'm not going without you.
1622

1623
1623
1623
02:10:26,378 --> 02:10:28,687
1623
- No. You have to go, now.
1623
- No, Jack.
1623

1624
1624
1624
02:10:29,018 --> 02:10:30,576
1624
Get in the boat, Rose.
1624

1625
1625
1625
02:10:30,658 --> 02:10:31,647
1625
No, Jack.
1625

1626
1626
1626
02:10:31,738 --> 02:10:33,456
1626
Yes. Get on the boat.
1626

1627
1627
1627
02:10:33,658 --> 02:10:35,535
1627
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.
1627

1628
1628
1628
02:10:38,619 --> 02:10:41,258
1628
My God. Look at you.
1628
You look a fright.
1628

1629
1629
1629
02:10:41,779 --> 02:10:42,814
1629
Here.
1629

1630
1630
1630
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:46,455
1630
Put this on. Come on.
1630

1631
1631
1631
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:53,611
1631
Go on. I'll get the next one.
1631

1632
1632
1632
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:55,577
1632
No, not without you.
1632

1633
1633
1633
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,616
1633
I'll be all right.
1633
Listen, I'll be fine.
1633

1634
1634
1634
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,737
1634
I'm a survivor, all right?
1634
Don't worry about me.
1634

1635
1635
1635
02:10:59,821 --> 02:11:01,015
1635
Now, go on. Get on.
1635

1636
1636
1636
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:03,740
1636
I have an arrangement with an officer
1636
on the other side of the ship.
1636

1637
1637
1637
02:11:03,821 --> 02:11:06,210
1637
Jack and I can get off safely.
1637
Both of us.
1637

1638
1638
1638
02:11:07,661 --> 02:11:09,857
1638
See? I got my own boat to catch.
1638

1639
1639
1639
02:11:09,942 --> 02:11:12,502
1639
- Go.
1639
- Come on, hurry. They're almost full.
1639

1640
1640
1640
02:11:13,782 --> 02:11:14,817
1640
Step aboard, miss.
1640

1641
1641
1641
02:11:14,902 --> 02:11:16,255
1641
- Go.
1641
- Come on, hurry.
1641

1642
1642
1642
02:11:17,062 --> 02:11:19,098
1642
- Step aboard, please.
1642
- You're Daddy's good girl.
1642

1643
1643
1643
02:11:19,182 --> 02:11:21,333
1643
- Step lively!
1643
- Keep back.
1643

1644
1644
1644
02:11:21,463 --> 02:11:23,101
1644
Keep back, I say.
1644

1645
1645
1645
02:11:24,863 --> 02:11:26,581
1645
Clear the rail, please.
1645

1646
1646
1646
02:11:27,583 --> 02:11:28,857
1646
Lower away!
1646

1647
1647
1647
02:11:32,424 --> 02:11:33,652
1647
Steady.
1647

1648
1648
1648
02:11:36,464 --> 02:11:38,534
1648
And lower away evenly, lads.
1648

1649
1649
1649
02:11:39,264 --> 02:11:40,253
1649
Easy.
1649

1650
1650
1650
02:11:40,704 --> 02:11:41,933
1650
Lower away.
1650

1651
1651
1651
02:11:42,025 --> 02:11:43,743
1651
You're a good liar.
1651

1652
1652
1652
02:11:43,905 --> 02:11:45,133
1652
Almost as good as you.
1652

1653
1653
1653
02:11:45,225 --> 02:11:47,898
1653
Easy, now. And lower away.
1653

1654
1654
1654
02:11:50,185 --> 02:11:53,258
1654
There's no ...
1654
There's no arrangement, is there?
1654

1655
1655
1655
02:11:54,906 --> 02:11:56,419
1655
No, there is.
1655

1656
1656
1656
02:11:56,626 --> 02:11:58,776
1656
Not that you'll benefit much from it.
1656

1657
1657
1657
02:11:58,866 --> 02:12:00,060
1657
And even away.
1657

1658
1658
1658
02:12:00,466 --> 02:12:01,455
1658
I always win, Jack.
1658

1659
1659
1659
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:03,344
1659
And lower away evenly, lads.
1659

1660
1660
1660
02:12:03,427 --> 02:12:04,496
1660
One way or another.
1660

1661
1661
1661
02:12:04,587 --> 02:12:07,260
1661
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.
1661

1662
1662
1662
02:12:08,347 --> 02:12:09,336
1662
Easy.
1662

1663
1663
1663
02:12:10,307 --> 02:12:11,581
1663
Even, lads.
1663

1664
1664
1664
02:12:12,187 --> 02:12:14,816
1664
Keep going!
1664

1665
1665
1665
02:13:00,512 --> 02:13:01,581
1665
Rose!
1665

1666
1666
1666
02:13:03,752 --> 02:13:05,151
1666
- Stop her!
1666
- Rose!
1666

1667
1667
1667
02:13:05,472 --> 02:13:07,384
1667
- What are you doing?
1667
- Stop her!
1667

1668
1668
1668
02:13:08,353 --> 02:13:09,388
1668
No!
1668

1669
1669
1669
02:13:26,954 --> 02:13:28,069
1669
Rose!
1669

1670
1670
1670
02:13:31,355 --> 02:13:34,028
1670
You're so stupid!
1670
Why did you do that?
1670

1671
1671
1671
02:13:34,435 --> 02:13:36,107
1671
You're so stupid, Rose.
1671

1672
1672
1672
02:13:37,835 --> 02:13:39,747
1672
Why did you do that? Why?
1672

1673
1673
1673
02:13:40,316 --> 02:13:42,193
1673
You jump, I jump, right?
1673

1674
1674
1674
02:13:44,276 --> 02:13:45,311
1674
Right.
1674

1675
1675
1675
02:13:47,356 --> 02:13:48,505
1675
Oh, God.
1675

1676
1676
1676
02:13:48,596 --> 02:13:50,986
1676
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.
1676

1677
1677
1677
02:13:51,557 --> 02:13:53,912
1677
It's all right.
1677
We'll think of something.
1677

1678
1678
1678
02:13:54,797 --> 02:13:56,833
1678
At least I'm with you.
1678

1679
1679
1679
02:14:09,918 --> 02:14:11,237
1679
Come on! Move!
1679

1680
1680
1680
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:13,467
1680
Come on!
1680

1681
1681
1681
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:15,911
1681
Come on! Move!
1681

1682
1682
1682
02:14:21,999 --> 02:14:23,149
1682
Come on!
1682

1683
1683
1683
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,715
1683
Move!
1683

1684
1684
1684
02:14:37,641 --> 02:14:39,040
1684
Come on, come on, Rose!
1684

1685
1685
1685
02:14:41,361 --> 02:14:42,760
1685
Rose, come on!
1685

1686
1686
1686
02:14:45,442 --> 02:14:46,511
1686
Move, Rose!
1686

1687
1687
1687
02:14:49,522 --> 02:14:50,557
1687
Go!
1687

1688
1688
1688
02:15:00,483 --> 02:15:02,633
1688
I hope you enjoy your time together!
1688

1689
1689
1689
02:15:16,605 --> 02:15:18,402
1689
What could possibly be funny?
1689

1690
1690
1690
02:15:19,285 --> 02:15:21,435
1690
I put the diamond in the coat.
1690

1691
1691
1691
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:26,316
1691
And I put the coat on her!
1691

1692
1692
1692
02:15:27,846 --> 02:15:29,040
1692
Come on.
1692

1693
1693
1693
02:15:47,367 --> 02:15:49,040
1693
Dada!
1693

1694
1694
1694
02:15:52,088 --> 02:15:53,487
1694
We can't leave him.
1694

1695
1695
1695
02:15:57,488 --> 02:15:58,921
1695
All right, come on!
1695

1696
1696
1696
02:16:00,609 --> 02:16:02,440
1696
Dada!
1696

1697
1697
1697
02:16:14,810 --> 02:16:15,879
1697
Go back!
1697

1698
1698
1698
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:28,606
1698
That's the wrong way! Come back!
1698

1699
1699
1699
02:16:35,092 --> 02:16:36,081
1699
Go!
1699

1700
1700
1700
02:16:38,412 --> 02:16:39,447
1700
Go!
1700

1701
1701
1701
02:16:40,332 --> 02:16:41,685
1701
Run, Rose!
1701

1702
1702
1702
02:16:48,813 --> 02:16:49,802
1702
Jack!
1702

1703
1703
1703
02:16:53,013 --> 02:16:54,447
1703
- Jack!
1703
- Rose!
1703

1704
1704
1704
02:17:06,735 --> 02:17:07,804
1704
This way!
1704

1705
1705
1705
02:17:16,816 --> 02:17:17,805
1705
Come on!
1705

1706
1706
1706
02:17:19,136 --> 02:17:20,455
1706
Give me your hand!
1706

1707
1707
1707
02:17:28,897 --> 02:17:30,216
1707
Oh, God!
1707

1708
1708
1708
02:17:34,537 --> 02:17:35,572
1708
Help!
1708

1709
1709
1709
02:17:41,098 --> 02:17:42,213
1709
Help!
1709

1710
1710
1710
02:17:44,138 --> 02:17:46,447
1710
Wait, sir! Sir,
1710
open the gate, please!
1710

1711
1711
1711
02:17:46,538 --> 02:17:48,928
1711
- Please!
1711
- Please, help us!
1711

1712
1712
1712
02:17:49,179 --> 02:17:50,692
1712
- Please!
1712
- Please!
1712

1713
1713
1713
02:17:51,899 --> 02:17:53,048
1713
Bloody hell!
1713

1714
1714
1714
02:17:56,299 --> 02:17:57,288
1714
Hurry.
1714

1715
1715
1715
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:00,452
1715
- Come on, come on!
1715
- Come on!
1715

1716
1716
1716
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:02,129
1716
Go, go!
1716

1717
1717
1717
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,289
1717
Jesus.
1717

1718
1718
1718
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:05,419
1718
- Please!
1718
- Come on!
1718

1719
1719
1719
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,729
1719
Hurry!
1719

1720
1720
1720
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:08,135
1720
Come on!
1720

1721
1721
1721
02:18:13,261 --> 02:18:14,933
1721
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.
1721

1722
1722
1722
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:16,935
1722
- Wait, please!
1722
- Wait!
1722

1723
1723
1723
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:21,055
1723
Don't leave! Please, send for help!
1723

1724
1724
1724
02:18:38,743 --> 02:18:40,814
1724
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?
1724

1725
1725
1725
02:18:41,104 --> 02:18:42,981
1725
The short one. Try the short one.
1725

1726
1726
1726
02:18:43,944 --> 02:18:45,218
1726
Hurry, Jack.
1726

1727
1727
1727
02:18:48,304 --> 02:18:50,295
1727
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.
1727

1728
1728
1728
02:18:50,544 --> 02:18:51,773
1728
Hurry, Jack.
1728

1729
1729
1729
02:18:54,305 --> 02:18:56,296
1729
It's stuck! It's stuck!
1729

1730
1730
1730
02:18:57,105 --> 02:18:59,016
1730
- Come on!
1730
- Hurry, Jack!
1730

1731
1731
1731
02:19:00,305 --> 02:19:01,784
1731
Hurry, Jack!
1731

1732
1732
1732
02:19:04,466 --> 02:19:06,741
1732
I got it! Go, Rose!
1732

1733
1733
1733
02:19:07,626 --> 02:19:09,059
1733
Go!
1733

1734
1734
1734
02:19:18,747 --> 02:19:20,021
1734
Jack!
1734

1735
1735
1735
02:19:21,987 --> 02:19:23,386
1735
Come on!
1735

1736
1736
1736
02:19:24,708 --> 02:19:25,982
1736
Move, move.
1736

1737
1737
1737
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:38,706
1737
- Get those oars in place.
1737
- Get an oar under it.
1737

1738
1738
1738
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:41,624
1738
Women and children only, damn you!
1738

1739
1739
1739
02:19:42,429 --> 02:19:44,989
1739
Hold it!
1739

1740
1740
1740
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:59,144
1740
Get these davits cranked in!
1740
Let's get the falls hooked up!
1740

1741
1741
1741
02:20:07,952 --> 02:20:09,180
1741
Stay back!
1741

1742
1742
1742
02:20:10,992 --> 02:20:12,311
1742
Mommy!
1742

1743
1743
1743
02:20:12,912 --> 02:20:14,504
1743
Stay back, sir!
1743

1744
1744
1744
02:20:15,912 --> 02:20:17,551
1744
Stay back, I say.
1744

1745
1745
1745
02:20:18,993 --> 02:20:20,426
1745
Keep going up!
1745

1746
1746
1746
02:20:23,193 --> 02:20:24,751
1746
Stop pushing!
1746

1747
1747
1747
02:20:25,713 --> 02:20:27,704
1747
Stay back!
1747

1748
1748
1748
02:20:27,793 --> 02:20:30,467
1748
Will you give us a chance to live,
1748
you limey bastard?
1748

1749
1749
1749
02:20:30,554 --> 02:20:33,273
1749
I'll shoot any man who tries
1749
to get past me! Get back!
1749

1750
1750
1750
02:20:33,354 --> 02:20:34,423
1750
Bastard!
1750

1751
1751
1751
02:20:34,514 --> 02:20:35,788
1751
Get back!
1751

1752
1752
1752
02:20:36,434 --> 02:20:38,345
1752
We had a deal, damn it!
1752

1753
1753
1753
02:20:40,675 --> 02:20:44,554
1753
Your money can't save you anymore
1753
than it can save me. Get back!
1753

1754
1754
1754
02:20:45,755 --> 02:20:47,473
1754
Women and children only!
1754

1755
1755
1755
02:20:49,876 --> 02:20:51,150
1755
Stop pushing!
1755

1756
1756
1756
02:20:53,276 --> 02:20:54,550
1756
No, Tommy!
1756

1757
1757
1757
02:20:55,076 --> 02:20:56,828
1757
No! No, Tommy!
1757

1758
1758
1758
02:20:57,516 --> 02:20:58,744
1758
Bastardo!
1758

1759
1759
1759
02:21:15,678 --> 02:21:16,906
1759
No, Will!
1759

1760
1760
1760
02:21:23,399 --> 02:21:24,388
1760
Now stand back, damn you!
1760

1761
1761
1761
02:21:28,199 --> 02:21:30,508
1761
Gently, hold it.
1761

1762
1762
1762
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,152
1762
I have a child!
1762

1763
1763
1763
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,833
1763
Clear a path!
1763

1764
1764
1764
02:21:44,921 --> 02:21:46,832
1764
Please, I have a child.
1764

1765
1765
1765
02:21:47,561 --> 02:21:50,029
1765
Please, I'm all she has in the world.
1765

1766
1766
1766
02:21:50,841 --> 02:21:51,876
1766
Go on.
1766

1767
1767
1767
02:21:52,241 --> 02:21:53,674
1767
Step back!
1767

1768
1768
1768
02:21:53,761 --> 02:21:54,751
1768
Please!
1768

1769
1769
1769
02:21:54,842 --> 02:21:56,798
1769
Here. Give her to me.
1769

1770
1770
1770
02:22:02,562 --> 02:22:04,280
1770
There, there.
1770

1771
1771
1771
02:22:08,083 --> 02:22:10,472
1771
Wait! Mr. Andrews.
1771

1772
1772
1772
02:22:12,963 --> 02:22:14,191
1772
Oh, Rose.
1772

1773
1773
1773
02:22:16,724 --> 02:22:18,954
1773
Won't you even make a try for it?
1773

1774
1774
1774
02:22:20,164 --> 02:22:23,918
1774
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
1774
a stronger ship, young Rose.
1774

1775
1775
1775
02:22:26,524 --> 02:22:28,516
1775
It's going fast. We have to move.
1775

1776
1776
1776
02:22:28,605 --> 02:22:29,640
1776
Wait.
1776

1777
1777
1777
02:22:32,645 --> 02:22:34,476
1777
Good luck to you, Rose.
1777

1778
1778
1778
02:22:35,925 --> 02:22:37,199
1778
And to you.
1778

1779
1779
1779
02:22:49,087 --> 02:22:51,806
1779
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.
1779

1780
1780
1780
02:22:51,887 --> 02:22:54,401
1780
No, thank you.
1780
We are dressed in our best ...
1780

1781
1781
1781
02:22:54,487 --> 02:22:57,081
1781
and are prepared to go down
1781
as gentlemen.
1781

1782
1782
1782
02:22:57,847 --> 02:22:59,486
1782
But we would like a brandy.
1782

1783
1783
1783
02:23:00,208 --> 02:23:02,085
1783
Get the falls over here now!
1783

1784
1784
1784
02:23:02,808 --> 02:23:05,242
1784
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!
1784

1785
1785
1785
02:23:11,609 --> 02:23:14,601
1785
Capitain, Capitain,
1785
where should I go? Please.
1785

1786
1786
1786
02:23:20,410 --> 02:23:22,970
1786
Captain. Sir.
1786

1787
1787
1787
02:23:52,773 --> 02:23:54,650
1787
Right. That's it, then.
1787

1788
1788
1788
02:23:55,653 --> 02:23:57,689
1788
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.
1788

1789
1789
1789
02:23:58,013 --> 02:24:00,527
1789
- Goodbye, Wallace.
1789
- So long, old chap.
1789

1790
1790
1790
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:15,089
1790
And so they lived happily
1790
together for 300 years ...
1790

1791
1791
1791
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:18,614
1791
in the land of "Tir na nÓg" ...
1791

1792
1792
1792
02:25:18,901 --> 02:25:21,210
1792
land of eternal youth and beauty.
1792

1793
1793
1793
02:25:55,664 --> 02:25:58,417
1793
There's no time! Cut the falls!
1793

1794
1794
1794
02:25:58,504 --> 02:26:00,859
1794
Cut them if you have to!
1794

1795
1795
1795
02:26:01,464 --> 02:26:03,695
1795
I need a knife!
1795

1796
1796
1796
02:26:05,225 --> 02:26:08,615
1796
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!
1796

1797
1797
1797
02:26:19,426 --> 02:26:21,223
1797
Cut those bloody falls!
1797

1798
1798
1798
02:27:06,751 --> 02:27:10,426
1798
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
1798
playing with you tonight.
1798

1799
1799
1799
02:28:08,956 --> 02:28:10,993
1799
We have to stay on the ship
1799
as long as possible.
1799

1800
1800
1800
02:28:11,077 --> 02:28:12,271
1800
Come on.
1800

1801
1801
1801
02:28:23,718 --> 02:28:25,629
1801
This way. Hold the rail.
1801

1802
1802
1802
02:28:27,438 --> 02:28:29,633
1802
Come on, Rose. Jump.
1802

1803
1803
1803
02:28:32,078 --> 02:28:33,228
1803
Come on.
1803

1804
1804
1804
02:29:05,322 --> 02:29:06,960
1804
I got you. Jump!
1804

1805
1805
1805
02:29:09,402 --> 02:29:11,120
1805
I've got you, miss.
1805

1806
1806
1806
02:29:11,562 --> 02:29:12,961
1806
- Jack!
1806
- What?
1806

1807
1807
1807
02:29:14,762 --> 02:29:15,798
1807
Back!
1807

1808
1808
1808
02:29:44,725 --> 02:29:46,397
1808
No, you'll swamp us!
1808

1809
1809
1809
02:29:54,406 --> 02:29:55,680
1809
Nobody panic.
1809

1810
1810
1810
02:29:58,887 --> 02:30:01,959
1810
Yea, though I walk through the
1810
valley of the shadow of death —
1810

1811
1811
1811
02:30:02,047 --> 02:30:04,720
1811
You want to walk a little faster
1811
through that valley, there?
1811

1812
1812
1812
02:30:52,692 --> 02:30:55,160
1812
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
1812
pray for us, sinners ...
1812

1813
1813
1813
02:30:55,252 --> 02:30:57,561
1813
now and at the hour
1813
of our death. Amen.
1813

1814
1814
1814
02:30:57,652 --> 02:30:59,085
1814
Hail Mary, full of grace ...
1814

1815
1815
1815
02:30:59,172 --> 02:31:00,366
1815
This way.
1815

1816
1816
1816
02:31:10,973 --> 02:31:12,372
1816
Come on!
1816

1817
1817
1817
02:31:21,334 --> 02:31:23,564
1817
And I saw a new heaven
1817
and a new Earth.
1817

1818
1818
1818
02:31:23,654 --> 02:31:26,965
1818
For the first heaven and the
1818
first Earth had passed away ...
1818

1819
1819
1819
02:31:28,255 --> 02:31:30,246
1819
and there was no more sea.
1819

1820
1820
1820
02:31:35,856 --> 02:31:38,893
1820
It'll be over soon.
1820
It'll all be over soon.
1820

1821
1821
1821
02:31:44,576 --> 02:31:46,169
1821
And he shall dwell with them ...
1821

1822
1822
1822
02:31:46,257 --> 02:31:47,975
1822
and they shall be his people ...
1822

1823
1823
1823
02:31:48,057 --> 02:31:51,493
1823
and God himself shall be with them
1823
and be their God.
1823

1824
1824
1824
02:31:52,617 --> 02:31:53,811
1824
Jack ...
1824

1825
1825
1825
02:31:54,617 --> 02:31:56,096
1825
this is where we first met.
1825

1826
1826
1826
02:32:03,178 --> 02:32:06,488
1826
And God shall wipe away
1826
all the tears from their eyes ...
1826

1827
1827
1827
02:32:06,578 --> 02:32:08,854
1827
and there shall be no more death ...
1827

1828
1828
1828
02:32:09,419 --> 02:32:11,933
1828
neither shall there
1828
be sorrow or crying ...
1828

1829
1829
1829
02:32:12,019 --> 02:32:14,487
1829
neither shall there
1829
be any more pain ...
1829

1830
1830
1830
02:32:14,859 --> 02:32:17,327
1830
for the former world has passed away.
1830

1831
1831
1831
02:32:31,621 --> 02:32:33,816
1831
Bloody pull faster! And pull!
1831

1832
1832
1832
02:32:56,223 --> 02:32:57,656
1832
Hang on, Miss Trudy!
1832

1833
1833
1833
02:33:31,906 --> 02:33:33,544
1833
Hold on real tight.
1833

1834
1834
1834
02:33:50,428 --> 02:33:51,827
1834
God almighty!
1834

1835
1835
1835
02:33:59,029 --> 02:34:01,384
1835
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!
1835

1836
1836
1836
02:35:17,396 --> 02:35:18,954
1836
We have to move!
1836

1837
1837
1837
02:35:24,157 --> 02:35:26,034
1837
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.
1837

1838
1838
1838
02:35:26,357 --> 02:35:28,348
1838
Come on, give me your hand.
1838

1839
1839
1839
02:35:30,597 --> 02:35:32,714
1839
I've got you. I won't let go.
1839

1840
1840
1840
02:35:32,798 --> 02:35:33,787
1840
Come on, I've got you.
1840

1841
1841
1841
02:35:44,879 --> 02:35:47,393
1841
- What's happening, Jack?
1841
- I don't know.
1841

1842
1842
1842
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:58,118
1842
- Hold on!
1842
- Jack!
1842

1843
1843
1843
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,270
1843
Somebody help me, please!
1843

1844
1844
1844
02:36:38,324 --> 02:36:39,643
1844
This is it!
1844

1845
1845
1845
02:36:51,245 --> 02:36:53,475
1845
Oh, my God, Jack!
1845

1846
1846
1846
02:36:54,605 --> 02:36:55,799
1846
Hold on!
1846

1847
1847
1847
02:37:10,327 --> 02:37:12,557
1847
The ship is gonna suck us down.
1847

1848
1848
1848
02:37:12,847 --> 02:37:14,439
1848
Take a deep breath when I say.
1848

1849
1849
1849
02:37:19,888 --> 02:37:22,243
1849
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.
1849

1850
1850
1850
02:37:22,328 --> 02:37:23,807
1850
Do not let go of my hand.
1850

1851
1851
1851
02:37:30,809 --> 02:37:33,277
1851
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.
1851

1852
1852
1852
02:37:33,369 --> 02:37:34,688
1852
I trust you.
1852

1853
1853
1853
02:37:39,168 --> 02:37:42,400
1853
Ready? Now!
1853

1854
1854
1854
02:38:17,692 --> 02:38:19,444
1854
Jack!
1854

1855
1855
1855
02:38:23,212 --> 02:38:24,566
1855
- Rose!
1855
- Jack!
1855

1856
1856
1856
02:38:29,013 --> 02:38:30,002
1856
Jack!
1856

1857
1857
1857
02:38:49,855 --> 02:38:51,447
1857
Jack!
1857

1858
1858
1858
02:39:02,056 --> 02:39:03,569
1858
Get off her!
1858

1859
1859
1859
02:39:07,136 --> 02:39:08,286
1859
- Rose!
1859
- Jack!
1859

1860
1860
1860
02:39:08,377 --> 02:39:10,607
1860
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!
1860

1861
1861
1861
02:39:14,337 --> 02:39:15,770
1861
Keep swimming.
1861

1862
1862
1862
02:39:19,498 --> 02:39:21,728
1862
- It's so cold.
1862
- Swim, Rose!
1862

1863
1863
1863
02:39:26,978 --> 02:39:28,697
1863
Come on. Here.
1863

1864
1864
1864
02:39:30,059 --> 02:39:32,209
1864
Keep swimming. Come on.
1864

1865
1865
1865
02:39:34,499 --> 02:39:36,091
1865
Here, get on it.
1865

1866
1866
1866
02:39:37,379 --> 02:39:38,812
1866
Get on top.
1866

1867
1867
1867
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:47,413
1867
Come on, Rose.
1867

1868
1868
1868
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:58,332
1868
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.
1868

1869
1869
1869
02:40:18,983 --> 02:40:20,814
1869
It'll be all right now.
1869

1870
1870
1870
02:40:22,864 --> 02:40:24,582
1870
You'll be all right now.
1870

1871
1871
1871
02:40:31,544 --> 02:40:34,423
1871
Return the boats!
1871

1872
1872
1872
02:40:38,265 --> 02:40:40,654
1872
The boats are coming
1872
back for us, Rose.
1872

1873
1873
1873
02:40:40,945 --> 02:40:43,061
1873
Hold on just a little bit longer.
1873

1874
1874
1874
02:40:43,145 --> 02:40:45,706
1874
They had to row away
1874
for the suction ...
1874

1875
1875
1875
02:40:46,946 --> 02:40:49,141
1875
but now they'll be coming back.
1875

1876
1876
1876
02:40:50,746 --> 02:40:52,065
1876
For God's sake!
1876

1877
1877
1877
02:40:52,146 --> 02:40:55,139
1877
Please help us!
1877

1878
1878
1878
02:41:00,267 --> 02:41:01,985
1878
You don't understand.
1878

1879
1879
1879
02:41:02,667 --> 02:41:06,786
1879
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.
1879
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.
1879

1880
1880
1880
02:41:06,868 --> 02:41:09,223
1880
Knock it off. You're scaring me.
1880

1881
1881
1881
02:41:09,548 --> 02:41:12,142
1881
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.
1881

1882
1882
1882
02:41:12,228 --> 02:41:15,504
1882
Are you out of your mind? We're in
1882
the middle of the North Atlantic.
1882

1883
1883
1883
02:41:15,588 --> 02:41:18,865
1883
Now, do you people want to live
1883
or do you want to die?
1883

1884
1884
1884
02:41:25,309 --> 02:41:27,540
1884
I don't understand a one of you.
1884

1885
1885
1885
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:32,427
1885
What's the matter with you?
1885
It's your men out there!
1885

1886
1886
1886
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:36,748
1886
There's plenty of room for more.
1886

1887
1887
1887
02:41:36,830 --> 02:41:38,662
1887
And there'll be one less on this boat.
1887

1888
1888
1888
02:41:38,751 --> 02:41:41,470
1888
If you don't shut
1888
that hole in your face!
1888

1889
1889
1889
02:41:56,952 --> 02:41:58,908
1889
Bring in your oars over there.
1889

1890
1890
1890
02:41:58,992 --> 02:42:01,507
1890
Tie these two boats together as well.
1890

1891
1891
1891
02:42:05,193 --> 02:42:07,912
1891
Now, make sure that's tied up
1891
nice and tight.
1891

1892
1892
1892
02:42:11,114 --> 02:42:13,503
1892
Right, listen to me, men.
1892
We have to go back.
1892

1893
1893
1893
02:42:13,594 --> 02:42:17,109
1893
I want to transfer all the women
1893
from this boat into that boat right now.
1893

1894
1894
1894
02:42:17,194 --> 02:42:18,513
1894
As quick as you can, please.
1894

1895
1895
1895
02:42:18,594 --> 02:42:21,063
1895
Let's create some space over there.
1895
Move forward and out.
1895

1896
1896
1896
02:42:30,435 --> 02:42:32,108
1896
It's getting quiet.
1896

1897
1897
1897
02:42:34,396 --> 02:42:39,106
1897
It's just going to take a couple of
1897
minutes to get the boats organized.
1897

1898
1898
1898
02:42:42,597 --> 02:42:44,428
1898
I don't know about you ...
1898

1899
1899
1899
02:42:44,517 --> 02:42:48,271
1899
but I intend to write
1899
a strongly-worded letter ...
1899

1900
1900
1900
02:42:48,357 --> 02:42:50,825
1900
to the White Star Line about all this.
1900

1901
1901
1901
02:42:57,718 --> 02:42:59,310
1901
I love you, Jack.
1901

1902
1902
1902
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:07,311
1902
Don't you do that.
1902

1903
1903
1903
02:43:08,599 --> 02:43:10,715
1903
Don't you say your goodbyes.
1903

1904
1904
1904
02:43:11,159 --> 02:43:13,275
1904
Not yet. Do you understand me?
1904

1905
1905
1905
02:43:13,879 --> 02:43:15,233
1905
I'm so cold.
1905

1906
1906
1906
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:17,553
1906
Listen, Rose ...
1906

1907
1907
1907
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:20,517
1907
you're gonna get out of here.
1907

1908
1908
1908
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:22,998
1908
You're gonna go on ...
1908

1909
1909
1909
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:26,075
1909
and you're gonna make lots of babies.
1909

1910
1910
1910
02:43:26,521 --> 02:43:28,637
1910
And you're gonna watch them grow.
1910

1911
1911
1911
02:43:29,881 --> 02:43:33,840
1911
You're gonna die an old lady,
1911
warm in her bed.
1911

1912
1912
1912
02:43:36,041 --> 02:43:37,236
1912
Not here.
1912

1913
1913
1913
02:43:37,802 --> 02:43:39,281
1913
Not this night.
1913

1914
1914
1914
02:43:39,682 --> 02:43:42,116
1914
Not like this.
1914
Do you understand me?
1914

1915
1915
1915
02:43:44,962 --> 02:43:46,680
1915
I can't feel my body.
1915

1916
1916
1916
02:43:48,803 --> 02:43:52,591
1916
Winning that ticket was the best thing
1916
that ever happened to me.
1916

1917
1917
1917
02:43:54,403 --> 02:43:56,121
1917
It brought me to you.
1917

1918
1918
1918
02:43:57,764 --> 02:43:59,994
1918
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.
1918

1919
1919
1919
02:44:00,684 --> 02:44:02,083
1919
I'm thankful.
1919

1920
1920
1920
02:44:04,124 --> 02:44:06,513
1920
You must ...
1920

1921
1921
1921
02:44:07,644 --> 02:44:09,203
1921
do me this honor.
1921

1922
1922
1922
02:44:12,245 --> 02:44:15,043
1922
You must promise me that you'll survive.
1922

1923
1923
1923
02:44:16,485 --> 02:44:18,794
1923
That you won't give up ...
1923

1924
1924
1924
02:44:20,086 --> 02:44:21,963
1924
no matter what happens.
1924

1925
1925
1925
02:44:24,406 --> 02:44:26,362
1925
No matter how hopeless.
1925

1926
1926
1926
02:44:29,967 --> 02:44:31,685
1926
Promise me now, Rose.
1926

1927
1927
1927
02:44:34,127 --> 02:44:36,436
1927
And never let go of that promise.
1927

1928
1928
1928
02:44:37,767 --> 02:44:39,041
1928
I promise.
1928

1929
1929
1929
02:44:41,288 --> 02:44:42,721
1929
Never let go.
1929

1930
1930
1930
02:44:45,528 --> 02:44:47,439
1930
I'll never let go, Jack.
1930

1931
1931
1931
02:44:50,248 --> 02:44:51,841
1931
I'll never let go.
1931

1932
1932
1932
02:45:15,011 --> 02:45:16,603
1932
Right ahead, sir.
1932

1933
1933
1933
02:45:19,571 --> 02:45:20,606
1933
Oars!
1933

1934
1934
1934
02:45:21,331 --> 02:45:23,128
1934
Do you see any moving?
1934

1935
1935
1935
02:45:24,012 --> 02:45:25,923
1935
No, sir. None moving, sir.
1935

1936
1936
1936
02:45:26,452 --> 02:45:27,771
1936
Check them.
1936

1937
1937
1937
02:45:28,092 --> 02:45:29,923
1937
Bring that oar up here.
1937

1938
1938
1938
02:45:35,733 --> 02:45:37,564
1938
Check them. Make sure.
1938

1939
1939
1939
02:45:37,933 --> 02:45:39,685
1939
These are dead, sir.
1939

1940
1940
1940
02:45:40,173 --> 02:45:42,448
1940
Now give way. Ahead easy.
1940

1941
1941
1941
02:45:49,174 --> 02:45:51,847
1941
Careful with your oars.
1941
Don't hit them.
1941

1942
1942
1942
02:45:54,654 --> 02:45:56,885
1942
Is there anyone alive out there?
1942

1943
1943
1943
02:45:58,415 --> 02:46:00,326

1945
1945
02:46:11,176 --> 02:46:12,655

1946
1946
1946
02:46:16,496 --> 02:46:18,852
1946
Keep checking them! Keep looking!

1947
1947
1947

1961
1961
1961
02:49:19,873 --> 02:49:21,705
1961

1962
1962
1962

There's nothing here, sir.

1963
1963
1963

1963

1964
1964
02:49:37,875 --> 02:49:40,628

1966
1966
02:50:44,521 --> 02:50:47,719
1966
1,500 people went into the sea ...
1966

1967
1967
1967
02:50:48,242 --> 02:50:51,075
1967
when Titanic sank from under us.
1967

1968
1968
1968
02:50:53,122 --> 02:50:55,875
1968
There were 20 boats floating nearby ...
1968

1969
1969
1969
02:50:57,202 --> 02:50:59,080
1969
and only one came back.
1969

1970
1970
1970
02:51:01,283 --> 02:51:02,272
1970
One.
1970

1971
1971
1971
02:51:04,003 --> 02:51:06,437
1971
6 were saved from the water ...
1971

1972
1972
1972
02:51:06,803 --> 02:51:08,362
1972
myself included.
1972

1973
1973
1973
02:51:09,764 --> 02:51:14,042
1973
6 out of 1,500.
1973

1974
1974
1974
02:51:17,204 --> 02:51:21,357
1974
Afterward,
1974
the 700 people in the boats ...
1974

1975
1975
1975
02:51:21,725 --> 02:51:24,034
1975
had nothing to do but wait.
1975

1976
1976
1976
02:51:25,805 --> 02:51:28,797
1976
Wait to die, wait to live.
1976

1977
1977
1977
02:51:30,286 --> 02:51:32,356
1977
Wait for an absolution ...
1977

1978
1978
1978
02:51:32,846 --> 02:51:34,757
1978
that would never come.
1978

1979
1979
1979
02:52:36,372 --> 02:52:38,647
1979
Sir, I don't think you'll find
1979
any of your people down here.
1979

1980
1980
1980
02:52:38,732 --> 02:52:40,324
1980
It's all steerage.
1980

1981
1981
1981
02:52:45,213 --> 02:52:48,046
1981
His hair is reddish brown,
1981
and a white beard.
1981

1982
1982
1982
02:52:48,173 --> 02:52:50,971
1982
- Isn't there another passenger list?
1982
- There's no other list.
1982

1983
1983
1983
02:52:51,053 --> 02:52:54,363
1983
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
1983
- We're doing all we can.
1983

1984
1984
1984
02:53:17,096 --> 02:53:19,610
1984
That's the last time I ever saw him.
1984

1985
1985
1985
02:53:19,816 --> 02:53:22,888
1985
He married, of course,
1985
and inherited his millions.
1985

1986
1986
1986
02:53:24,056 --> 02:53:27,173
1986
But the crash of '29
1986
hit his interests hard.
1986

1987
1987
1987
02:53:27,576 --> 02:53:30,137
1987
And he put a pistol
1987
in his mouth that year.
1987

1988
1988
1988
02:53:30,457 --> 02:53:31,856
1988
Or so I read.
1988

1989
1989
1989
02:53:44,458 --> 02:53:46,574
1989
Can I take your name, please, love?
1989

1990
1990
1990
02:53:48,858 --> 02:53:49,974
1990
Dawson.
1990

1991
1991
1991
02:53:52,219 --> 02:53:53,572
1991
Rose Dawson.
1991

1992
1992
1992
02:53:54,659 --> 02:53:55,933
1992
Thank you.
1992

1993
1993
1993
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:06,454
1993
We never found anything on Jack.
1993
There's no record of him at all.
1993

1994
1994
1994
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:09,297
1994
No, there wouldn't be, would there?
1994

1995
1995
1995
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:14,457
1995
And I've never spoken of him
1995
until now. Not to anyone.
1995

1996
1996
1996
02:54:15,261 --> 02:54:17,331
1996
Not even your grandfather.
1996

1997
1997
1997
02:54:17,621 --> 02:54:20,897
1997
A woman's heart
1997
is a deep ocean of secrets.
1997

1998
1998
1998
02:54:22,222 --> 02:54:25,498
1998
But now you know there was a
1998
man named Jack Dawson ...
1998

1999
1999
1999
02:54:25,982 --> 02:54:27,779
1999
and that he saved me ...
1999

2000
2000
2000
02:54:28,262 --> 02:54:31,015
2000
in every way
2000
that a person can be saved.
2000

2001
2001
2001
02:54:33,263 --> 02:54:35,652
2001
I don't even have a picture of him.
2001

2002
2002
2002
02:54:38,223 --> 02:54:41,932
2002
He exists now only in my memory.
2002

2003
2003
2003
02:54:46,784 --> 02:54:49,503

Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way
2003
to the surface.
2003

2004
2004
2004
